sundaymorningstaple,"Oh, if you are thinking how good Scanteak appears, you might also want to give them a miss. I've been fooled by them for years (although I've never bought anything as their prices to too inflated - I didn't realize how much until the run-up to CNY this year). I love the run-up to CNY as I am a recycler type of woodworker. I love people throwing away old hardwood furniture which I break down and repurpose. This year I came across a teak bedframe with nice long wood rails down each side. Clearly marked with the Scanteak logo into the wood at one end of each rail. After bringing them back to the house I started to removed the inner slat rails and low and behold, those bed rails are NOT solid wood at all but a very heavy dense type of particleboard (not quite MDF but close) that has real teak veneer on ALL sides/edges and end grain, covering all traces of the false centres. The stuff is garbage. Buyer beware.",brian_singapore,"I am will shortly be moving to a work from home arrangement where I will be working from a home office 2 weeks a month.

x9200,"Another place to take a look around is Scanteak. Again, this is not a top quality furniture store (I would not recommend to buy anything there for the outdoor), neither the cheapest one but it offers some better balance to the Ikea's offer.

We decided to have our own furniture ca 5y ago and it took us a few good months to roughly complete the task. We are also a price cautious (low-end expats) but we simply wanted to have something that we like and this something should also last a bit longer.

With this conditions it is rather difficult to buy all the stuff in a single place so we just checked around in a number of places and picked up what we wanted. If this matters we prefer rather simplistic, zen-like style.

The major concentrations of furniture shops are (at least 5y ago):
- the Furniture mall (off the Beach Rd)
- the Sungei Kadut district - probably over dozens of shops all together half of them along Sungei Kadut Ave
- Dempsey area shops (already gone)

We were disappointed with the Furniture Mall. It was very expensive for anything we liked over there.

All together this is roughly the list of the places we bought some furniture from:
1) http://unicane.com (abaca sofa and chairs)
2) Scanteak (few minor tower chests of drawers, all teakish, each piece below $100 and most of them looking like they were made by a drunk carpenter)
3) a lot of stuff from Ikea (Beno CD racks, expedit shelves)
4) Furniture Mall (rather expensive, some custom made teak furniture in a place I could not recommend because we almost sued them for the job done and they almost sued me for alleged defamation).
5) Dempsey area, Holland Village, Furniture Mall (minor furniture, side tables etc.)",sundaymorningstaple,"I've not been to a vhive in a long, long time.

Essentially I want a round table (maybe 1m diameter) and 2-4 chairs (could probably get away with 2 cheapo folding chairs from Ikea and 2 that match the table, as it's only me and the missus most of the time).

I've been here about 6 months and still can't get my head around Singaporean websites - none of them have prices on which means I spend more time clicking ""back"" than I do looking at the designs...

I'm looking to spend 2-400 dollars (ideally at the low end). Most of the major ones I've seen recommended (OHMM etc) seem to charge about this per chair.

Has anyone used the furniture sales that I've seen online? Would they be worth a shot? I can't be bothered to get a cab to go there if I find out the prices are still astronomically high. Any advice/experience would be welcome.

sundaymorningstaple,For mid-upper range furniture you can do Scanteak or Pickett & Rail.,Girl_Next_Door ,"I would think furniture and art might be some things you want to consider?

Yes, Singapore have Ikea and several cheap options. However, there isn't exactly much ""in-between"" and ""good quality"" furniture around (or I am looking at the wrong places). Also assuming that you plan to get a bigger apartment (with 2 kids), I find most of the furnitures here are quite small. A lot of 2 or 3 seaters, but very few 6 or 8 seaters that doesn't cost 5-figures.

And of course, you can find a fully furnished apartment/condo but very often, it will be furnished in accordance to the owner's taste and/or in cheap furniture.

For art work, I am sure many people will say you can get cheap art work in neighbouring countries like Thailand and Vietnam.

testerjp,"Tried them at HN and quite pricey, not sure if it's pure latex top, don't feel so to me for those in the affordable range. Mattresses are suppose to be replaced once every 6-8 years. So not sure if you really wish to fork that amount every time. Research shows that replacing the mattress regularly provides the best support to the back as the mattress will sag or the springs will lose its dexterity. I was looking for latex top too, scanteak was selling at $14xx, tilamking $17xx. 65% of the rubber in the world comes from South east Asia, the rest mostly from Asia like India and Vietnam. Don't make sense to me to get an European brand for latex, most likely they will need to import the latex, process then export, adds up to cost for nothing.

d3n,"Our offline purchases As the saying says.... BBBMTL! (Buy Buy Buy Mai Tu Liao!) especially when there is a sale... since there is not much of a difference if you buy now or later... since there is a sale... might as well! Especially if it is a necessity and not want for your new home. For furniture, since ours a mainly a Scandinavian theme, we go for mostly pencil leg furniture... which makes our living space looks bigger. TIP: - Sign up for Robinson OCBC card, it will be very useful especially the additional 5% cash rebates + close door sales for members! - Takashimaya vouchers is very valuable as it has no expiry date! So store it for your new home purchases! Any other vouchers like Robinsons voucher also very valuable to save further for your home needs purchase. Furnitures: 1. Comfort Design Furniture - http://www.comfortfurniture.com.sg/ We find their prices slightly more competitive than Castlery. Quality wise is still very decent for this price. We bought our Sofa set, Dining Table set (bench + 2 chairs), small coffee table. 2. Scanteak - http://www.scanteak.com.sg/ This is more of a want... as I quite love the solid build of their furniture, so decided to splurge on their bed frame for the Master bedroom and also a small sturdy table that is on sale to hold my dry cabinet of my precious camera equipment. 3. Muji - http://www.muji.com.sg/ My wife love their stand mirror (full length), since we got a $30 313 voucher which we got from the purchase of a Sony TV, might as well! 4. Robinsons - http://robinsons.com.sg/ We missed out on their black friday sale to purchase their Simmons backcare 4 series mattress which goes as low as $3.2k after discounts and members rebate as my friend's card limit wasn't enough, and that pushes me to go apply the card myself lol. We placed a $200 deposit with Robinson Bedshop (look for Sheila if you want to purchase Simmons mattress) at their Heeren branch. This effectively locks their price (which ever is lower when there is a promo). So as of now we are still waiting for their additional 10% card member rebate... We also bought loads of other stuffs which I will cover later below. 5. Inkagu - https://www.inkagu.com/products/shin-ju-mattress Always see their special price mattress ad on Facebook and since it cost only $299... so BBBMTL, this is for our guestroom. 6. Ki-mono - http://www.ki-mono.net A pity they are closing down... they have very nice japanese theme furnitures which we can match our Scandinavian theme. We bought a rack for kitchen use and also a clothe rack at very attractive closing down sale price. Appliances: 1. Sony store @ 313 Just happens so... my buddy's wife works at Sony so yes! we can get staff price. Bought Sony TV KDL-55W800C at $1.2k+! Cheap right? 2. Heritage Bathroom Gallery Ironically we didn't buy any bathroom stuffs from them but bought from them a Fujioh hob & hood set and Bosch oven ($50 cheaper than other shops we went!). 3. Gain City Initially we wanted to buy our Electrolux washing machine & dryer from Paris Silk but they cannot hold stock for us too long... so in the end we went to Gain City to buy from them. Price slightly higher than what was quoted by Paris Silk. 4. Tim Wong (Aircon) from Renotalk - For our Mitsubishi Starmex (2 tick) air con 5. Mega Discount (Kallang Leisure Park) - https://www.megadiscountstore.com.sg/ Initially we are eyeing a Hitachi or Mitsubishi refrigerator but after the sales person show us what a Samsung fridge can do and the build quality + door test... we are sold! Just hope that it doesn't *chibaboom* later! lol 6. Robinsons Used my wife's vouchers ($350) to buy Zojirushi Induction Heating Rice Cooker NP-HBQ10 which is at promotion price $489 but we only paid $139! Got a free rice stocker as well. 6. Philips Carnival Sale (once a year!) Bought some stuffs during the sale last year, steam garment iron + iron + toaster + kettle. 7. AOSBath - https://www.aosbath.com/ Bought a 40L digital model storage heater (AO Smith) for convenience and electricity savings. 8. HT Lighting (Johor Bahru, Permas Jaya) - http://www.htlightings.com/ Bought ceiling fan Aeratron AE3 50' Light Oak color for 1480rm, SG selling this for $1099 SGD! If anyone need their sales contact number (via whatsapp) to check price before going in to buy let me know! Others: 1. Hansgrohe We bought a bundle deal during their warehouse sale last year October. We was given a 25% voucher which we went to buy additional Tap and shower set for the common toilet. 2. Robinsons Too many things to buy here especially kitchen use... Le Creuset, WMF, Corelle, Lock & Lock, Bodum, bedsheets etc during their member or public sale! We also make use of my wife's Citibank redemption of Robinson vouchers as well. I also got my NS voucher which I am keeping to buy the Simmons mattress haha 3. Takashimaya I accumulated $230 voucher prior to this... bought a tefal air fryer on promotion at $279... so we only paid $49 for it LOL 4.

When I first got the latex mattress, I initially tot that the old one felt more comfy. Overtime, the body used to it liao. I kind of regret though, because i couldn't find Mylatex to try initially. I bought the Tilamking one. If I could choose again, I would had tried the full latex ones first before deciding. Not that I mean Tilamking one is not good though, I think they are very well made. Just that the price is not far from a Mylatex's full latex. You can find the Mylatex range here http://myaerofoam.com/en/collections/mylatex/ Take note the range sold in SG maybe different but the above link can give you a rough idea what to expect. If i'm not wrong, most full latex can flip, meaning you can use for a longer time. Better verify with the sales regarding this. The scanteak one imo is very soft and it's not even talalay.

pacificstorm,"Wow! Finally someone who went to all the shops I went to. For dormiente, was the one you tried the one where u could split the mattress into the male and female one? I remember the 18cm version was their classic range. The lady actually introduced the 23cm range with the horsehair? For me as she said I was slighty heavier (90kg heavy to german company meh... ) You are right to say 18cm is on the thin side though but I would say with a full latex mattress that is unlikely to affect the feel or performance of the mattress. From her explanations I also heard they had a coconut coir version used in their firmest bed, if u were looking at that version, I would strongly suggest going without the coconut (again) With European bedding I was actually looking at heveya 1, the one with only 1 layer of latex. This solely based on my personal logic that if I do use different layers of latex they must be varying densities which makes my money less worthwhile if I get lower density one . I remember this is 19cm high, still abit low. But the price range also on the lower side. I ultimately decided with european bedding over dormiente as I done some research online and found that the Latexco company was alot more renown and seems to be the largest latex MNC that even have plants in USA. I was also slightly skeptical about the horse hair on the Dormiente tbh. At the IMM shop, actually I tried the maxcoil relaxer which was their latex mattress first and that was what I shortlisted. It didn't have the fanciful 7 zone latex like the 2 brands neither was it Organic latex (although I personally think natural is enough, organic probably doesn't matter since not food..) but the price also more attractive obviously. This one was a 25cm so actually more good height for us. The very friendly guy then told us to try the royal brilliance, said it was their best selling model. If u followed my post u would have known for I actually only look at full latex mattress... but eventually the feel of the mattress was good and convincingly enough that the 4"" of latex at the top is good enough (this time I was called average weight hahahahah). More importantly the latex is also made by latexco so they were actually similar to what I saw at European bedding, plus the info presented on the mattress were similar. Honestly if u ask me, I would only choose between the heveya 1 and royal brilliance. (My wife doesn't like the maxcoil relaxer for unknown reasons). U would have seen another bro chaos that had booked the relaxer but seems his partner also like royal better ************************************ As for hilker, I do remember searching on it being a malaysian company licensed from the germans. So the price doesn't make sense at all. For the frame, I would reccomend not getting from dormiente or european bedding. Afterall they are latex producers not wood company... u may be better off with scanteak or castlery etc for wooden frames?

Think they disappeared for a long time",snowydust,"Hello everyone, I have been reading through the 200+ pages for the past few days as i plan to get a bed for my new home. Happened to try to Hilker Full Latex and Latex + Spring yesterday at Harvey Norman (Millenia Walk) and went down to Dormiente, European Bedding and Uni Spring today. My fiance and I were impressed with the latex mattresses and i think it is really not easy to make a choice among them. Hilker - They have full latex and latex + spring series. But i think this brand isn't discussed much here, so not much reviews gathered. - Was initially impressed but after trying the Dormiente, Heveya and MaxCoil today, we are probably not going to consider this even though Harvey Normal has attractive promotions now, additional 30% on top of 30% promo. Dormiente We are interested with getting the EU/SG Queen Mattress, have to say it is really comfortable. We do have some concerns, namely: - the mattress is 18cm only, is this fairly normal for a full latex mattress as we think it is pretty short compared to European Bedding Heveya 2 (24cm). - While the price of the mattress seems relatively reasonable, the bed frame by them is pretty costly albeit very good quality solid wood. Are there any recommendations where we can get the bed frame (open to non-wood materials)? European Bedding All the 3 models are full natural latex. Like the Heveya 3 but it is like what everyone here mentioned, european price! Add in the Soul & Table bed frame will probably cost more than 8k. Maxcoil @ Unispring Tried the Royal Brilliance, Jardine I & II (all are natural latex topper with spring). - We like Royal Brilliance the most but the bed is really heavy. - While i can feel a little difference compared to the above 2 brands, it is really pretty minimal. - The price seems to be very attractive.

domon17th,Bro just curious. Any reason why you didn't consider getha or mylatex?,pacificstorm,"Wow! Finally someone who went to all the shops I went to. For dormiente, was the one you tried the one where u could split the mattress into the male and female one? I remember the 18cm version was their classic range. The lady actually introduced the 23cm range with the horsehair? For me as she said I was slighty heavier (90kg heavy to german company meh... ) You are right to say 18cm is on the thin side though but I would say with a full latex mattress that is unlikely to affect the feel or performance of the mattress. From her explanations I also heard they had a coconut coir version used in their firmest bed, if u were looking at that version, I would strongly suggest going without the coconut (again) With European bedding I was actually looking at heveya 1, the one with only 1 layer of latex. This solely based on my personal logic that if I do use different layers of latex they must be varying densities which makes my money less worthwhile if I get lower density one . I remember this is 19cm high, still abit low. But the price range also on the lower side. I ultimately decided with european bedding over dormiente as I done some research online and found that the Latexco company was alot more renown and seems to be the largest latex MNC that even have plants in USA. I was also slightly skeptical about the horse hair on the Dormiente tbh. At the IMM shop, actually I tried the maxcoil relaxer which was their latex mattress first and that was what I shortlisted. It didn't have the fanciful 7 zone latex like the 2 brands neither was it Organic latex (although I personally think natural is enough, organic probably doesn't matter since not food..) but the price also more attractive obviously. This one was a 25cm so actually more good height for us. The very friendly guy then told us to try the royal brilliance, said it was their best selling model. If u followed my post u would have known for I actually only look at full latex mattress... but eventually the feel of the mattress was good and convincingly enough that the 4"" of latex at the top is good enough (this time I was called average weight hahahahah). More importantly the latex is also made by latexco so they were actually similar to what I saw at European bedding, plus the info presented on the mattress were similar. Honestly if u ask me, I would only choose between the heveya 1 and royal brilliance. (My wife doesn't like the maxcoil relaxer for unknown reasons). U would have seen another bro chaos that had booked the relaxer but seems his partner also like royal better ************************************ As for hilker, I do remember searching on it being a malaysian company licensed from the germans. So the price doesn't make sense at all. For the frame, I would reccomend not getting from dormiente or european bedding. Afterall they are latex producers not wood company... u may be better off with scanteak or castlery etc for wooden frames? Any idea btw if the aussino is like the old aussino or they sell completely diff stuff now? Think they disappeared for a long time",,,Forum,18/8/19 11:07,2019,HardwareZone,scanteak

pacificstorm,"Nice to see your response bro. For the european bedding, I am guessing maybe the part timer wanted more commission so push the more ex heveya 2 and 3. Didn't had this issue when I was there. In fact comparing heveya 1 which was 19cm of full latex, the 18cm at dormiente would be obsolete base on the part timer's logic, which obviously wasn't the case. In fact I am quite sure with 18 or 19cm it is more than adequate to withhold my weight, I think I wasnt even using any more than 2 inches of the latex (in terms of depression into the mattress) Did u also try the maxcoil relaxer by any chance? I feel it felt quite similar to the firm one I tried at dormiente. Though it seems most people preferred Royal Brilliance instead... As for Hilker, if u went to their website u would see they are manufactured under Hilker Sdn Bhd, did some googling and it pointed to the following links below. Apparently they are under a licensing right of the germany company but made by a factory that produces a few different brands in Malaysia. Their pricing would be more relevant if it was german made like dormiente, but I don't think it would be reasonable to pay for a ""royalty or licensing"" fee made in Malaysia. https://buy.ramcreditinfo.com.my/index.php/search/Malaysia-Company/1109958/HILKER-MALAYSIA-SDN.-BHD The malaysian factory that licenses different brands, https://www.luxurysleep.com Hope to hear from you again",snowydust,"For dormiente, i was not served by the owner but a new salesman who just joined the company.

testerjp,"Most companies use the dunlop vulcanization method for producing the latex, not that there are no synthetic material used but the chance is lesser. More or less, there should be some stabilisers. Even if there's any, I reckon that it will still be better than memory foam or high density foam made out of petroleum, which also traps the most heat. All I can see from the online description for Mylatex is they label as fully natural with nothing synthetic for most range. Their price is the cheapest and they been around for quite some time. Of course, how true are their words will be up to you to decide. That easyhouse website is the cheapest but I could also find such prices from a brick and mortar shop at Alexandra Village. I've tried Mylatex from a shop at IMM, their prices are pricey. Scanteak and Tilamking also have latex top range. There are also brands like Getha, dormiente, etc. You can check those out if you want. Mylatex seems to sell via reseller network, don't expect those sales staff's knowledge to be much.",,,,,Forum,3/7/18 02:00,2018,HardwareZone,scanteak
