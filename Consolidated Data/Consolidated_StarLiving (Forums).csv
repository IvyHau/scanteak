QLevi,"My parents got excellent wedding gifts. All these are almost 40 years old:
 
 
 
 1) Takahi slowcooker. It only has three settings - Off, High, Auto.
 
 
 
 2) Zojirushi boiler with only Boil and Warm settings. I'm not certain how healthy it is to use such an old boiler but we're not dead yet so... 
 
 
 
 3) Le creuset pot that looks good as new. We baby it though. 
 
 
 
 Various Scanteak furniture that are 20+ years old. Still solid despite our v rough treatment (e.g. water stains, scratches). 
 
 
 
 Surprisingly, a STAR Living junior wardrobe made of shitty material has lasted us almost 30 years. It's refusal to break down = uncle still using a kiddy pastel blue wardrobe. We stack 10kg luggages on the thing all the time and it's still perfectly fine?

gretsall,"Yes, most room rentals are furnished with essentials for tenantsâ€™ convenience. Bed, small desk, wardrobe etc. Most landlords wouldnâ€™t go through the hassle of cabling LAN from router to the spare room. Hence, itâ€™s the norm to provide just wifi. Most of us rent out spare rooms, so you may be living with the landlord. Get to know them &amp; their rules before committing.
 
 
 
 I used to work in One-North area too :) Iâ€™d recommend staying in the west. If you want to save more, find a house that isnâ€™t near malls, or a little distance away from MRT(bus transfer). You can go to food centres &amp; supermarkets in residential areas. And commute a few stops to malls for shopping/movies on days off. The places I recommend below have malls near the MRT. 
 
 -Buona Vista (Mall: Star Vista/no cinema)
 
 -Jurong East (3 malls. Busy area)
 
 -Bukit Batok (West Mall)
 
 -Boon Lay (Mall: Jurong Point)

heedyouradvice,"thanks for the reply JR8, but personally i had some pretty bad experience buying from Ikea..bubbles forming on the surface, shaky cabinet, veneer splitting..therefore would like to buy solid wood furniture this time and from another source.

then again, i'm still months away from moving in to my new home. will be visiting the big box stores Star living, courts, etc. and hopefully find what i want!

i'm just wondering whether there are any ""lesser known"" stores but selling beautiful solid wood furniture thus for this post..

thanks again JR8, appreciate your help!",JR8,"We got our dining room chairs from IKEA. A simple/classic design, made from solid birch (a hardwood) with upholstered seat that could be removed so the covers could be removed and laundered. Very solidly made, looked great, relatively inexpensive for what they were.
Like these -> http://www.ikea.com/sg/en/catalog/products/30162109/
$55, what a bargain!
A dining table is going to be more expensive, look for extendible or 'drop-leaf' tables that can be extended when the seating space is required and otherwise folded down or away (if you need to).

I'm quite a fan of IKEA. Some product lines are great (like those chairs) and some tend to be crappy (IME arm-chairs/sofas)

Yasha_Lim,"hi All, just wish to warn you people if you want to buy furniture from the Star Living furniture. i bought a set of furnitures from Star Furniture at a cost of about S$5,000 in mid 2011 and I was informed that the furnitures will be given 1-year of warranty. little did i know that immeidately after the warranty period, the furnitures (sofa set, coffee table, TV table) started to develop cracks. i immediately called the company to complain about this and do you know what they replied me? they told me that as the warranty has expired, i would need to pay for them to come and investigate and i would need to pay for all the repair work if i so wish. after i told them that i will complain to CASE and expose them in the media, they quickly replied that they will waive the cost for them to investigate but i will still need to pay for all repair work. the purpose of this thread is to warn you folks out there who is contemplating to purchase furnitures. if you wish to purchase furnitures that will last only for the very short-term, Star Furniture will be right for you. by the way, they have 4 lines of brand and are as follows: 1) Zen Tradition Living; 2) Mondi Lifestyle Gallery; 3) Lucano; and 4) Star Living.",,,,,"19-01-2013, 11:14 PM",2013,HWZ
