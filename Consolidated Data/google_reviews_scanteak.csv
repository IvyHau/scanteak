"Very disappointed about my recent purchase. I purchased the so-called designer range Mono chair 2 weeks ago, after careful usage for for less than 2 weeks, found the chair top surface got scratched badly by the zip head of the original ‚Ä¶"
"Mostly a very nice showroom with their entire range available to view. I liked the range a lot.

Showroom is a little cramped in places, so a bit difficult to view from a distance, though in this, it's still better than many other places. ‚Ä¶"
"Melvin was very helpful and offered us advise while we were trying to decide which sofa and coffee table to purchase. He was also very patient with us when we were going around, back and forth on our decision. Great experience!"
I entered the showroom and was warmly greeted by Carol. She was polite and allowed me to browse the items in the showroom before answering my enquires about the pieces on display. She was able to provide useful advice and product knowledge which helped me in buying decision. Great service :)

"Was really inaccessible, but great space and furniture all-around!"
Very detailed explanation by Sam. Staff wasn‚Äôt pushy and allowed us to have our own moment to decide. We were comfortable when handled by them. Price was reasonable as well.
Great service and wasnt pushy to purchase the products even when they were closing. Value for money for the quality of their products. Will come back again in future to purchase more.
Recently purchase the cabinet and very disappointed.  The cabinet delivery two times still chip-off.  No quality control.  Don't ever buy your furniture again.
Nice furniture selection. Managed to snag a good deal for a full leather sofa ledig. Served by May. Do find her when you are here.
Chris was very helpful in helping us choose the right sofa for the house. There is great designs at affordable price - worth a visit!
"Nice, good quality futniture. Lots of choices.  Some items are so popular, we have to wait a while for delivery. Will be back again next time. Good service from Ms Choy Har! Thank you!"
"Friendly and helpfull staff.
Items quality look good."
But no public bus to scanteak. Need to take  gain city free bus to reach location.
"If you are looking for wood furniture, you can have a visit there. However the showroom is pretty small. Hence you won't find lots of varieties. I think the quality seems to be good. Can be expensive."
Good place to look for household furnishing. Clean cut and modern design.
Wish they would sell the knitted pouf.
Warehouse sale ongoing. Very good qualities
"If you're into simple, modern wood furniture this place is for you. Expensive. Staff was friendly."
Beautiful furniture that made to last.
Love the Scandinavian styled furniture!
Great buy and friendly stufg

"Most ridiculous experience I have ever had. When I went in at 5 pm , there were no staff around and lights were switched off."
Nice furniture
Warehouse sales is not spectacular or particularly interesting.
"(Translated by Google) This is the best furniture I have ever used, but I forgot what wood it is. Has anyone told me what wood it is?

"staff was nice and friendly, while viewing the furniture he even offered coffee. thumbs up~"
"At first I was daunted by the appearance of a skinhead salesman but after further interactions, the salesman was quite friendly. I had some special request for CNY and he managed to arrange for delivery before CNY. Surprisingly friendly and helpful staff by the name of Chris"
The staff in this showroom really attitude problem!
"My sofa set gave way before coming to 2 full years.

Emailed scanteak. Because there is a servicing email on their Web. But was told they don't do any repair.

How can a piece of solid wood furniture break down so fast."
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. One of the best Scanteak branch that I would recommend you to drop by and purchase
Good quality. But limited designs

Great shop for teak furnitures. Excellent customer service by Mr Daniel.
"great showroom with all the scanteak offerings

convenient parking in the back, this show room is quite a walk from the paya lebar mrt station. perhaps it's an indication of the clientele they are targeting as the teak furniture is quite ‚Ä¶"
Variety of teak furnitures. Our reason for visiting scanteak was the good customer service rendered by Mr. Daniel.
Came in to shop with 20mins left to closing time. Shop girl greeted us ‚Äòthat they were already closed‚Äô. We couldn‚Äôt even look around for 5 mins. Great service. Business must be good.
Quality furniture
"Was told that this quaint building is more than 100 yrs old. *Gosh* The staff was very friendly & helpful, and there are some really good bargains onsite. Furniture is of good quality & reasonably priced."
Good place to have a look for teak furniture.
"There is ample parking space just outside the store, very convenient for people who drive. The store is spacious, sales person is  very helpful and familiar with the product.üëç"
Very nice wood furniture ranging from coffee tables to beds. Not bad prices for this premium kind of product and the service staff are very friendly. They let you try out the product before you buy as they have everything on display here and are nice to you even if you don't buy.
Furniture of great quality  that eschew warmth and personality.
Nice teakwood Scandinavian design furniture features simple and clean lines. The showroom here has a good selection and helpful staff.
Great deals and services
