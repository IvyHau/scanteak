WittyKap0,"Depends on what you consider decent
 
 
 
 If you want solid wood base probably need 3-4k and up. 
 
 
 
 Can look at King living for something cheaper in the 1k+ range
 
 
 
 Those cheap taobao couch at places like castlery can cost 500-1k but durability and comfort is super low. 
 
 
 
 You can probably get some cheaper sofas from the big furniture stores but personally they look ugly and old fashioned, comfort isn't great either.

ryecotta,"You could try:
 
 
 
 1. Carousell - sort of like Ebay. Lotsa second hand IKEA or even vintage items, lightly used and very cheaply. I even got my dining set free from another Singaporean who was migrating. 
 
 
 
 2. Hock Siong - physical shop with limited one-off pieces. Check out their IG here: https://instagram.com/hocksiong
 
 
 
 3. Second Charm - also a physical shop with one-off second hand vintage pieces: https://instagram.com/second.charm
 
 
 
 4. Castlery and Hipvan - Lotsa Singaporeans get their furniture there. They are fairly well designed and affordable. Sorta like IKEA. 
 
 
 
 5. Noden - second hand well curated Scandinavian furniture and sideboards. However, they are not cheap save for one or two smaller items.

Crate and barrel can be comfy too if you get the right models. I also liked the full grain leather Ikea couch which was 4-5k but the construction was really shitty, what a waste. 
 
 
 
 Of course I assume you care about aesthetics too... Otherwise you could probably find a comfy and ugly couch from somewhere like idk Harvey Norman or king living

Orangeyaglad13,"Everyone in this thread has been awesome but his is outstanding. I have discovered the property guru and some of the furniture places. I love second hand stuff so I am excited about checking out castlery. I am moving for work and itâ€™d be a three year assignment. My ideal situation is moving everything when I fly out there so I will definitely have to talk to the airline. My work is covering moving costs, so that is nice. Itâ€™s really daunting to think about buying all new stuff and I donâ€™t really want to bring anything besides clothes and a few other items. I think renting a filly furnished apt is the way to go. 
 
 
 
 Work will be around raffles or 10ish miles to the east. Iâ€™m looking into condos in that area as well. Very exciting to see whatâ€™s out there but Iâ€™ve heard I really shouldnâ€™t look until the month before I move since thatâ€™s how rentals work.

milo_peng,"Depends on what is your budget or what you mean by recommended. Places like Lush, Comfort Furniture, Hip Van they get their stuff mostly from Malaysian factories. Pull aside the product branding (e.g Nesthouz) and you get....Hin Lim Sdn Bhd (http://www.hinlim.com/). **In other words, overpriced Malaysian furniture being sold to Singaporeans under fancy brands. Do yourself a favor and avoid them.** 
 
  
 
 
 
 Teak furniture is also similar as teak has many grades. Scanteak is reasonably price for their stuff and I got no complaints so far. There is also Mountain Teak, Originals and Teak Avenue but those are expensive shit. I am using a bedframe from Widhardja. The quality is rough, but the wood is ok so far. Have another bedframe from Castlery and it was ok.

 For quality sofas, Crate and Barrel fabric sofas are actually pretty good value given the construction if you like the American style. I'm picking one up at the end of the year. V furniture seemed OK as well.

d3n,"Our offline purchases As the saying says.... BBBMTL! (Buy Buy Buy Mai Tu Liao!) especially when there is a sale... since there is not much of a difference if you buy now or later... since there is a sale... might as well! Especially if it is a necessity and not want for your new home. For furniture, since ours a mainly a Scandinavian theme, we go for mostly pencil leg furniture... which makes our living space looks bigger. TIP: - Sign up for Robinson OCBC card, it will be very useful especially the additional 5% cash rebates + close door sales for members! - Takashimaya vouchers is very valuable as it has no expiry date! So store it for your new home purchases! Any other vouchers like Robinsons voucher also very valuable to save further for your home needs purchase. Furnitures: 1. Comfort Design Furniture - http://www.comfortfurniture.com.sg/ We find their prices slightly more competitive than Castlery. Quality wise is still very decent for this price. We bought our Sofa set, Dining Table set (bench + 2 chairs), small coffee table. 2. Scanteak - http://www.scanteak.com.sg/ This is more of a want... as I quite love the solid build of their furniture, so decided to splurge on their bed frame for the Master bedroom and also a small sturdy table that is on sale to hold my dry cabinet of my precious camera equipment. 3. Muji - http://www.muji.com.sg/ My wife love their stand mirror (full length), since we got a $30 313 voucher which we got from the purchase of a Sony TV, might as well! 4. Robinsons - http://robinsons.com.sg/ We missed out on their black friday sale to purchase their Simmons backcare 4 series mattress which goes as low as $3.2k after discounts and members rebate as my friend's card limit wasn't enough, and that pushes me to go apply the card myself lol. We placed a $200 deposit with Robinson Bedshop (look for Sheila if you want to purchase Simmons mattress) at their Heeren branch. This effectively locks their price (which ever is lower when there is a promo). So as of now we are still waiting for their additional 10% card member rebate... We also bought loads of other stuffs which I will cover later below. 5. Inkagu - https://www.inkagu.com/products/shin-ju-mattress Always see their special price mattress ad on Facebook and since it cost only $299... so BBBMTL, this is for our guestroom. 6. Ki-mono - http://www.ki-mono.net A pity they are closing down... they have very nice japanese theme furnitures which we can match our Scandinavian theme. We bought a rack for kitchen use and also a clothe rack at very attractive closing down sale price. Appliances: 1. Sony store @ 313 Just happens so... my buddy's wife works at Sony so yes! we can get staff price. Bought Sony TV KDL-55W800C at $1.2k+! Cheap right? 2. Heritage Bathroom Gallery Ironically we didn't buy any bathroom stuffs from them but bought from them a Fujioh hob & hood set and Bosch oven ($50 cheaper than other shops we went!). 3. Gain City Initially we wanted to buy our Electrolux washing machine & dryer from Paris Silk but they cannot hold stock for us too long... so in the end we went to Gain City to buy from them. Price slightly higher than what was quoted by Paris Silk. 4. Tim Wong (Aircon) from Renotalk - For our Mitsubishi Starmex (2 tick) air con 5. Mega Discount (Kallang Leisure Park) - https://www.megadiscountstore.com.sg/ Initially we are eyeing a Hitachi or Mitsubishi refrigerator but after the sales person show us what a Samsung fridge can do and the build quality + door test... we are sold! Just hope that it doesn't *chibaboom* later! lol 6. Robinsons Used my wife's vouchers ($350) to buy Zojirushi Induction Heating Rice Cooker NP-HBQ10 which is at promotion price $489 but we only paid $139! Got a free rice stocker as well. 6. Philips Carnival Sale (once a year!) Bought some stuffs during the sale last year, steam garment iron + iron + toaster + kettle. 7. AOSBath - https://www.aosbath.com/ Bought a 40L digital model storage heater (AO Smith) for convenience and electricity savings. 8. HT Lighting (Johor Bahru, Permas Jaya) - http://www.htlightings.com/ Bought ceiling fan Aeratron AE3 50' Light Oak color for 1480rm, SG selling this for $1099 SGD! If anyone need their sales contact number (via whatsapp) to check price before going in to buy let me know! Others: 1. Hansgrohe We bought a bundle deal during their warehouse sale last year October. We was given a 25% voucher which we went to buy additional Tap and shower set for the common toilet. 2. Robinsons Too many things to buy here especially kitchen use... Le Creuset, WMF, Corelle, Lock & Lock, Bodum, bedsheets etc during their member or public sale! We also make use of my wife's Citibank redemption of Robinson vouchers as well. I also got my NS voucher which I am keeping to buy the Simmons mattress haha 3. Takashimaya I accumulated $230 voucher prior to this... bought a tefal air fryer on promotion at $279... so we only paid $49 for it LOL 4. IKEA Bought their pull out cabinet to be integrated with our kitchen cabinet. Also bought accessories for kitchen use. 5. Hoe Kee They are the only one carrying Blanco brand for kitchen sink in SG, so not much of a choice! 6. Big Bath (Johor Bahru) -http://www.bigbath.com.my/ Since we went to HT Lighting to buy ceiling fan, drop by here to bought some bathroom accessories from them, automatically given discount without asking haha.

pacificstorm,"Their storagebed is one of the best I have seen so far, but I didn't buy it as I am thinking to reuse my old frame. It is generally cheaper to buy with a bundle. If u plan to go with storage can go with theirs. However whether u want a hydraulic storage bed is entirely dependent on whether u have the use for the space below, some say its easier to get frames with leg for easy cleaning under the bed. Personally I rather not have legs so won't see don't see and no need to clean lol... But if ur furnishing requires wooden frame then u have to look elsewhere, most peeps would go to scanteak castlery etc to find wooden frames, there's a lack of those in IMM if u are interested in one. Most importantly remember whatever frame u buy always get one without gaps at the base which is very common in wooden frames. Even if it is fully wrapped with leather or fabric try to press and feel if it is slatted under the exterior. If u get slatted base ur warranty will likely be voided base on experiences of many.",Ivanlee80,Thank you so much for the summary.

pacificstorm,"Wow! Finally someone who went to all the shops I went to. For dormiente, was the one you tried the one where u could split the mattress into the male and female one? I remember the 18cm version was their classic range. The lady actually introduced the 23cm range with the horsehair? For me as she said I was slighty heavier (90kg heavy to german company meh... ) You are right to say 18cm is on the thin side though but I would say with a full latex mattress that is unlikely to affect the feel or performance of the mattress. From her explanations I also heard they had a coconut coir version used in their firmest bed, if u were looking at that version, I would strongly suggest going without the coconut (again) With European bedding I was actually looking at heveya 1, the one with only 1 layer of latex. This solely based on my personal logic that if I do use different layers of latex they must be varying densities which makes my money less worthwhile if I get lower density one . I remember this is 19cm high, still abit low. But the price range also on the lower side. I ultimately decided with european bedding over dormiente as I done some research online and found that the Latexco company was alot more renown and seems to be the largest latex MNC that even have plants in USA. I was also slightly skeptical about the horse hair on the Dormiente tbh. At the IMM shop, actually I tried the maxcoil relaxer which was their latex mattress first and that was what I shortlisted. It didn't have the fanciful 7 zone latex like the 2 brands neither was it Organic latex (although I personally think natural is enough, organic probably doesn't matter since not food..) but the price also more attractive obviously. This one was a 25cm so actually more good height for us. The very friendly guy then told us to try the royal brilliance, said it was their best selling model. If u followed my post u would have known for I actually only look at full latex mattress... but eventually the feel of the mattress was good and convincingly enough that the 4"" of latex at the top is good enough (this time I was called average weight hahahahah). More importantly the latex is also made by latexco so they were actually similar to what I saw at European bedding, plus the info presented on the mattress were similar.

Happened to try to Hilker Full Latex and Latex + Spring yesterday at Harvey Norman (Millenia Walk) and went down to Dormiente, European Bedding and Uni Spring today. My fiance and I were impressed with the latex mattresses and i think it is really not easy to make a choice among them. Hilker - They have full latex and latex + spring series. But i think this brand isn't discussed much here, so not much reviews gathered. - Was initially impressed but after trying the Dormiente, Heveya and MaxCoil today, we are probably not going to consider this even though Harvey Normal has attractive promotions now, additional 30% on top of 30% promo. Dormiente We are interested with getting the EU/SG Queen Mattress, have to say it is really comfortable. We do have some concerns, namely: - the mattress is 18cm only, is this fairly normal for a full latex mattress as we think it is pretty short compared to European Bedding Heveya 2 (24cm). - While the price of the mattress seems relatively reasonable, the bed frame by them is pretty costly albeit very good quality solid wood. Are there any recommendations where we can get the bed frame (open to non-wood materials)? European Bedding All the 3 models are full natural latex. Like the Heveya 3 but it is like what everyone here mentioned, european price! Add in the Soul & Table bed frame will probably cost more than 8k. Maxcoil @ Unispring Tried the Royal Brilliance, Jardine I & II (all are natural latex topper with spring). - We like Royal Brilliance the most but the bed is really heavy. - While i can feel a little difference compared to the above 2 brands, it is really pretty minimal. - The price seems to be very attractive. Hope to have some advice here. Thanks in advance!",,,,"18-08-2019, 01:08 AM",2019,HardwareZone

pacificstorm,"Nice to see your response bro. For the european bedding, I am guessing maybe the part timer wanted more commission so push the more ex heveya 2 and 3. Didn't had this issue when I was there. In fact comparing heveya 1 which was 19cm of full latex, the 18cm at dormiente would be obsolete base on the part timer's logic, which obviously wasn't the case. In fact I am quite sure with 18 or 19cm it is more than adequate to withhold my weight, I think I wasnt even using any more than 2 inches of the latex (in terms of depression into the mattress) Did u also try the maxcoil relaxer by any chance? I feel it felt quite similar to the firm one I tried at dormiente. Though it seems most people preferred Royal Brilliance instead... As for Hilker, if u went to their website u would see they are manufactured under Hilker Sdn Bhd, did some googling and it pointed to the following links below. Apparently they are under a licensing right of the germany company but made by a factory that produces a few different brands in Malaysia. Their pricing would be more relevant if it was german made like dormiente, but I don't think it would be reasonable to pay for a ""royalty or licensing"" fee made in Malaysia. https://buy.ramcreditinfo.com.my/index.php/search/Malaysia-Company/1109958/HILKER-MALAYSIA-SDN.-BHD The malaysian factory that licenses different brands, https://www.luxurysleep.com Hope to hear from you again",snowydust,"For dormiente, i was not served by the owner but a new salesman who just joined the company.
