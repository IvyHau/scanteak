Be truthful, be honest and be critical of your own contribution.
Final Presentation
Your final presentation must include the above information but summarized into a 15-20 minute verbal presentation.
- ALL members must be present during the presentation on campus (missing members will be penalized for missing the final presentation).
- All members must be in the front of the Seminar Room and be able to field any questions asked.
- No need to dress up (e.g. business suits, etc. NOT needed).
- Your final presentation must quickly remind the audience of who your client is, what the main business problem is.
- You should spend more time on your analysis & results - what you've completed since Week 9.
- If you have a system you want to demonstrate, please do so. In the past, groups have done: 1) quick 2-3 minutes re-cap of client/business problem, data crawled/received, 2) spent the remainder of presentation time on analyses and insights.
- Please omit "Team Contribution" as part of your presentation.
