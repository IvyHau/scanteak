Basic furniture - better than IKEA . Affordable prices. Nothing fancy here.

Glad that you are happy with our products :) Thank you for your review!

"Good, prices are cheap and affordable. Furnitures are good too"

Had a very good experience at Star Living @ Labrador thanks to Mr Marverik Chai. We were looking for furniture for my parents and he patiently showed us all the available options.

Helpful staff. A good place for furniture hunting
"Hi Ben, we apologise for the poor experience you had with us. As per our investigation, there seems to be a miscommunication between us. For your kind information, do note that our Jack-N Coffee Table comes with a rotatable drawer on one side and a fixed panel on the other side, hence it requires some allowance for the rotation mechanism to be smooth, which explain the slight slant. In fact, we have been selling this model for quite some time and all customers are able to accept it. Hence, we regret to inform you that we are unable to let you exchange for free as the slight difference in table height is not a product defect. However, should you decide to exchange for another model at a surcharge, do let us know and we will be happy to assist you :)"
"Hi Eldad, thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are sorry to hear about the poor experience you had with us.

We have investigated your case. Your sofa has been delivered for 3mths before we receive your first complaint. We have been responsive and have done our best to expedite the repair from the usual 8 weeks down to 1 week, despite currently operating at limited capacity due to COVID-19.

Yesterday, 8 June 2020, we delivered the repaired sofa to you, however it has been rejected due to the uneven foam & you have requested for a refund instead. We regret to inform that as the sofa you bought was a display piece cleared at 20% discount as-is condition, hence it will not be valid for exchange, cancellation or refund as agreed upon purchase.

However, we would still like to make this right for you and have brought the sofa back to service again, we will expedite on this again.

We hope you can see that we are already doing our best for you and we hope you can reconsider and accept the sofa after the 2nd servicing.

Thank you."
"Hi George, first and foremost, we would like to apologize for your series of poor experiences with us.

Understand that our delivery team only managed to reach your premise last night at around 11:25pm despite the agreed timing of 7-9pm, we sincerely would like to apologize for that. We seek your kind understanding that we are in our peak season now due to CNY and have been delivering till late night everyday, even to wee hours. Nevertheless, the lack of update from our delivery team on the delay after 9pm is definitely our wrongdoing, and we apologise for that on their behalf.

At the same time, we noted that you have tried to call our Tampines showroom last night to check on the delivery status and it was our sales staff TC Tan who has answered your call. We understood from him that the line was cut off a few times due to poor signal & technical issues, and he did not assist to check with our delivery team on the status of your delivery due to shop closing. This is indeed poor service and very unprofessional, rest assure that we will not tolerate that and a stern warning has been served to TC Tan.

Once again, we apologize for all the inconvenience that we have caused and thank you for your patience and understanding. Your valuable feedback matters to us and rest assure that we will definitely share with our delivery team & TC Tan to improve on it.

Understand that there is no further issue after the installation yesterday, hence we would like to close this case on our end. Should there be any issue pertaining to product, do feel free to contact us at 6269-2022 or customercare@sg.starintlgroup.com.

Hereby wishing you & family a happy & prosperous CNY, stay safe!"
"Hi Rachel, thank you for your review. We are really glad that you have enjoyed your time with us and especially so with our Sales Staff - Andrew. We will definitely share it with him and our Management. Thank you 😊"
"Hi Rui Fa Lin, thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We're sorry to hear about your experience with us. Regret to inform that as of now, we do not have any tie ups or regular contractors that we work with with regards to such wet works, hence we are not able to provide any suitable recommendations. We seek your kind understanding in this matter. Thank you."
"Hi Wilma, thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are sorry to hear about the poor experience you had with our Hercules Chair. We have checked your record, your Chairs have actually been delivered 22 months ago.

For your kind information, our Hercules Chair is made of PU (a synthetic leather) and not genuine leather. Do note that PU is an eco-friendly material with a nice soft touch, hence is less resistant to stress and may peel over time. Furthermore, peeling may occur due to many reasons, such as usage, environment (eg humidity, direct sunlight), wear and tear etc. But generally with proper care, PU products should be able to last 2-3 years minimally.

Usually, we will still be able to provide reupholstery at a fee for on-going models even as long as more than 5 years. Unfortunately, Hercules Dining Chair has been discontinued by the factory itself; hence we regret to inform that we will not be able to repair it & we seek your understanding in this matter.

Understand that our sales staff has already contacted you to propose some resolutions, hence we will proceed to close this loop on our end.

Once again, we apologise for the inconveniences caused and we thank you for selecting Star Living (LUCANO) as your preferred retailer. We sincerely look forward to be at your service again."

"Knowledgeable and understand customer’s needs, thumb up for professionalism shown by Rochelle. 👍"
"Large furniture mall with many different retailers offering a large variety of furniture types, be it traditional marble from Poly-art to more contemporary styling from Novena, also something for those looking for wood furniture."
Large selection of so so furniture at average prices. They offer entry to a bit of style for those with a limited budget. Furniture quality isn't great but will do the job.
Large variety of reasonably priced furniture with good service and free delivery for purchases above $500.
Liked this place for their good range of reasonably priced products.
Looking nice quality good  very cheap 👌👍price
"Looks promising, reasonably priced furniture (those in the main building not Zen or Jotter Goods next door since those are premium pieces). Definitely can give IKEA a run for its money. We spotted a couple of potentials but we haven't bought yet, will update score / review once we have tried out their products."

Nice
Nice furniture
Nice furnitures at affordable prices
Nice place at decent prices. Free parking too.
Nice place to look at beds but the staff are weird
Nice place to look for interesting finds. Was pleasantly surprised to chance upon this store offering an ecletic mix of furniture as it is tucked away neatly in a corner opposite ARC. Been wondering why we have not visited earlier!
Nice range of furniture... staff not that friendly..... price ranges
Nice selection of furniture and themes
Nice showroom to carry different in house brand of furniture. Serve by patient and knowledgeable sales manager Mr James. Thanks you.
Not good
Not many choices but the quality of furniture got standard.
Nothing much unless you are looking for something there
Nothing much you can't find at their showroom at IMM. Prices are similar.  No point going all the way to the warehouse location which is out of the way.
"Novena and Star Living is vy quiet now during these Covid season, along whole stretch only my car park alone there. BUT...!!!! Let me tell you.... Inside they are many & many furnitures on display for super sale which they are now not on advertisement. GRAP & GO now....!"

Poor service
"Potential consumers please be cognisant of the poor after sales service . I've recently bought a coffee table at their store but later found out that the top was slanted . Upon contacting them , the request for an exchange for another item was consistently declined. Highly unjustified and extremely disappointed."
Pretty good place. All fixed price which is good.
Pretty well stocked but seems a little pricer than the other shops.

Quality furniture.. Great service.. Prices is reasonable
Quality furnitures but the shop layout is not ergonomic.
Quality n awesome furniture

"Quite a good variety of quality living & dining room furnitures, as well as bed frames & mattresses. Love the home accessories as well. Staff were all friendly and helpful."
"Range of furnishings available but not TOP quality, nevertheless affordable n befitting the price range. Staff are helpful and stock is usually obtainable if low waiting time. Some of the designs are unique n quite fashionable. Good range of decor also available n there are many outlets all over SG."
Reasonable furnishings
Reasonable priced furniture.
Reasonable pricing
Relatively new building. Helpful staffs. 👍🏼 but location alittle inaccessible.

Smindy is very patient and friendly. She provided wonderful service and we bought a sofa from her on the same day.
"So glad we found out about this place before settling for generic and common options.

Great outlet for designer interiors. Sofas. Dining tables. TV entertainment units. Accessories.

A must visit before buying basic anywhere else.

We will be back!"
So so furniture
Staff are quite pushy and they follow you around as if you might run off with their dining table anytime. Redeeming factor will be the affordability of their furnitures.
"Staff could be friendlier. Three floors of furniture to browse through, in varied styles though some were kinda tacky to me."
"Star living is my first choice when it comes to buying any furniture items. Key thing is the niche quality of items, very competitive price and most important, externally warm, polite and informative sales team. James, the sales manager …"
"Strongly recommended.

My tempered glass dining table broke and I went to visit Star Living. Their Sungei Kadut branch is filled with many great variety, you will be spoiled with so many great choices.

I bought on last Sunday, and delivered today. Very efficient."
"Summary: look for Terry

good selection & quality items. Most importantly a sales person that listens to you rather than trying to sell."
Super
"Superb showroom with loads of selection, location is very convenient & accessible. Designs are great with options for vintage or modern lovers alike but fabrics & colors selection are very restricted, options for desired fabrics & colors is possible with an add on cost which could be costly as it's in %. ⭐"
Superlative service by Sharon for fickle buyers like we. It took us 2 hours to decide on a dining table and chairs. Extensive variety to choose from. Great prices.
TC awesome service!  Recommended!!
"TC from Star Living Tampines attended to us and was extremely patient and helpful! We took a good 3 hours here and he took us through the long hours, explaining the pros n cons of each item and giving recommendations without being too pushy. Thank you!"

I purchased a sofa which after two months springs started to come out and it has been a nightmare to get it fixed.

Beware of star living... my recommendation don’t buy!!!"
"Thank you Alson, very helpful and informative!"
Thank You smindy ! Kind and patient
"The 1st time we walked over from Ikea, the whole building had power failure. Will re-visit & re-rate this place."
"The biggest star living store I have been. If you are going to star living, only go to this store."
The furniture are pretty average looking. Some are not even worth looking at. Value for money but i wouldn't want to put any of these furniture in my house. Folks with budget would find this place pretty good.
"The place is good, gives you a variety of choice but what stands out for me is James who is the store manager. There was a compatibility issue for the bed and mattress that I bought from here in terms of size but James was quick to resolve the issue which is an example of great customer service"
"The sales person, Smindy is super friendly and helpful with all my inquiries."
The service staff here are attentive and not pushy. Makes decision-making easy!
The staff were helpful
The store just opened for the day yet they serve us as though its been a whole day at work. Sluggish and poor service.

"Was served by James, he is very patient and willing to share his experience. Bought our new sofa from you. Star living have many affordable choices to choose from, totally worth our trip! Thank you! :)"
"Was served by Smindy at Star living Furniture Mall Toh Guan. Very sincere and patient lady, well spoken and bright personality. We understand more about size, material, and if our choices are suitable for our overall house design. We purchased 2x from her and will always call her before we come over for our next furniture shopping"
"Was served by Smindy, top class customer service from her. Very enthusiastic at serving my family and showcasing different furniture to my family too. Thx star living"
Waste of time going to this place. Sales person lacks the knowledge - absolutely no business sense. Asked if they can recommend a 3rd party contractor to install a plaster wall behind the wardrobe - clueless and no idea. Pricing is not exactly cheap. No wonder we are being replaced by foreigners.
"We are amazed by the courteous and patience of Ms Smindy to attend us around the showroom.
Thank you again."
"We are served by Ken, so happy and pleased being served by him, very resourceful and patience with our queries.
