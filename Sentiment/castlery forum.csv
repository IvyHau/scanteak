120,"good mattress is one without memory foam especially not on the top (because of heat and voc, webmd says not suitable for babies too), the more funny layers there is the more foam you are getting so the more easier to sag. general natural latex full or with pocket spring is best desired. cooling natural fabric is good. cooling gel on top is no good (chemicals) many asking about jb mylatex's full latex but like nobody bought any, got one bro bought from sg on qoo10 the tara model, shop name is medalion (maybe spell wrong). to skip mylatex carson (search few pages back to know why) good place to search for mattress and furniture is furniture mall and imm. in imm you will also find the maxcoil shop that alot of bros here bought the jardin or royal brilliance. myself included. it is better to buy the frame with the mattress as there is normally package deal. if you buying wooden frame make sure there is no gaps at the base aka slatted base. popular for wooden frame i think is scanteak and castlery. ++ attention bros that haven't payment finish at the imm maxcoil shop, other than grabpay now they accept paywave. used my uob ppv for 1k deposit. 4000 miles into pocket",2019,0.18,0.791,0.029,0.9883

124,"wow! finally someone who went to all the shops i went to. for dormiente, was the one you tried the one where u could split the mattress into the male and female one? i remember the 18cm version was their classic range. the lady actually introduced the 23cm range with the horsehair? for me as she said i was slighty heavier (90kg heavy to german company meh... ) you are right to say 18cm is on the thin side though but i would say with a full latex mattress that is unlikely to affect the feel or performance of the mattress. from her explanations i also heard they had a coconut coir version used in their firmest bed, if u were looking at that version, i would strongly suggest going without the coconut (again) with european bedding i was actually looking at heveya 1, the one with only 1 layer of latex. this solely based on my personal logic that if i do use different layers of latex they must be varying densities which makes my money less worthwhile if i get lower density one . i remember this is 19cm high, still abit low. but the price range also on the lower side. i ultimately decided with european bedding over dormiente as i done some research online and found that the latexco company was alot more renown and seems to be the largest latex mnc that even have plants in usa. i was also slightly skeptical about the horse hair on the dormiente tbh. at the imm shop, actually i tried the maxcoil relaxer which was their latex mattress first and that was what i shortlisted. it didn't have the fanciful 7 zone latex like the 2 brands neither was it organic latex (although i personally think natural is enough, organic probably doesn't matter since not food..) but the price also more attractive obviously. this one was a 25cm so actually more good height for us. the very friendly guy then told us to try the royal brilliance, said it was their best selling model. if u followed my post u would have known for i actually only look at full latex mattress... but eventually the feel of the mattress was good and convincingly enough that the 4"" of latex at the top is good enough (this time i was called average weight hahahahah). more importantly the latex is also made by latexco so they were actually similar to what i saw at european bedding, plus the info presented on the mattress were similar. honestly if u ask me, i would only choose between the heveya 1 and royal brilliance. (my wife doesn't like the maxcoil relaxer for unknown reasons). u would have seen another bro chaos that had booked the relaxer but seems his partner also like royal better ************************************ as for hilker, i do remember searching on it being a malaysian company licensed from the germans. so the price doesn't make sense at all. for the frame, i would reccomend not getting from dormiente or european bedding. afterall they are latex producers not wood company... u may be better off with scanteak or castlery etc for wooden frames? any idea btw if the aussino is like the old aussino or they sell completely diff stuff now? think they disappeared for a long time",2019,0.16,0.808,0.032,0.9978

126,"for dormiente, i was not served by the owner but a new salesman who just joined the company. the 18cm one is indeed the one which has 1 side each for male and female. i was also introduced to the 23cm one which i think is the one u mentioned it with the horsehair. it seems to be more comfortable but it is around 2k more than the classic range. for european bedding, we didn't tried heveya 1 as the sales person (i think he is a part-timer) mentioned it is typically for younger crowd, so we only tried heveya 2 and 3. for hilker, i tried to google and it seems to be a legit german company but they do have cooperation partners in malaysia and taiwan. i guess we probably have to go back try again as it can get really confusing when buying a mattress. overall, we were quite impressed by the sales person from hilker, dormiente (tho he is relatively new to the company but not the industry) and unispring. they seem to be very knowledgeable and also taught us what to look out for when selecting a bed and not hardselling or pushy. we will probably drop by scanteak and castlery as the price of the bed frames seem to be more reasonable. kind of strange tho that both dormiente and european bedding selling bed frames with slatted based (tho the gaps for slatted base may be smaller than the usual slatted base in other wooden frames) i wonder now if it is easy to find eu queen bed frames and bedsheets in singapore . i have not been to the aussino store at hbf so can't really comment much. lastly, @pacificstorm and fellow forumers, thanks for sharing, have learnt quite a lot from all the posts in this thread.",2019,0.075,0.899,0.026,0.9518
127,"nice to see your response bro. for the european bedding, i am guessing maybe the part timer wanted more commission so push the more ex heveya 2 and 3. didn't had this issue when i was there. in fact comparing heveya 1 which was 19cm of full latex, the 18cm at dormiente would be obsolete base on the part timer's logic, which obviously wasn't the case. in fact i am quite sure with 18 or 19cm it is more than adequate to withhold my weight, i think i wasnt even using any more than 2 inches of the latex (in terms of depression into the mattress) did u also try the maxcoil relaxer by any chance? i feel it felt quite similar to the firm one i tried at dormiente. though it seems most people preferred royal brilliance instead... as for hilker, if u went to their website u would see they are manufactured under hilker sdn bhd, did some googling and it pointed to the following links below. apparently they are under a licensing right of the germany company but made by a factory that produces a few different brands in malaysia. their pricing would be more relevant if it was german made like dormiente, but i don't think it would be reasonable to pay for a ""royalty or licensing"" fee made in malaysia. https://buy.ramcreditinfo.com.my/index.php/search/malaysia-company/1109958/hilker-malaysia-sdn.-bhd the malaysian factory that licenses different brands, https://www.luxurysleep.com hope to hear from you again",2019,0.077,0.899,0.024,0.8906
