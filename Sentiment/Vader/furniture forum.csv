33,"If you buying from local shops you can guess which variation they are selling. The honest ones will tell you the truth too. A lot of our teak is Indonesian. Cos Burmese teak is very expensive now. Burmese teak are from very old trees. Stronger, darker in colour. Walnut is very confusing cos there are many versions and imposters. 1. American Black Walnut (Juglans nigra) - The best you can get, grows in North America. 2. South American Walnut (Albizia saman) - Totally different species but looks similar at first glance cos it also has sapwood. Grows in South America 3. Suar, Raintree, Monkeypod - Same as 2. But exported by the Spanish to S.E Asia. The weather is different here so the wood grows differently. Less dense, softer and more unstable than the South American ones. I didn't read up much on rosewood and oak when buying my furniture. Some honest people I know are at Tan Boon Liat where I bought a lot of my stuff. Grey and Sanders for American Black Walnut, and UnikHome for Teak. Grey and Sanders are nice and friendly and they love wood. So you can go chit chat with them and build your knowledge.

35,"Yah I think so. Teak is far superior to rubberwood. Teak used to be what ships were made of. Rubberwood grows fast, is pretty plentiful in S.E Asia and very easy to work with, that's why a lot of furniture uses it here now. Another low cost popular wood here is Nyatoh. Nowadays though, the popular low cost options would be to buy laminated plywood furniture. Laminates have come a long way, with really nice designs. I just haven't seen any that have duplicated the chatoyancy of real wood. Anyway, from the wood database - Teak Rot Resistance: Teak has been considered by many to be the gold standard for decay resistance, and its heartwood is rated as very durable. Teak is also resistant to termites, though it is only moderately resistant to marine borers and powder post beetles. Rubberwood Rot Resistance: Rubberwood is perishable, and has very little natural resistance to decay.

Coupled with the fact that Indonesian kilns are also relatively new, less skilled and impatient. What happens is you get a wood table that is still drying out and changing shape. Over time it will crack. What some factories try to do to counter this is to make table tops out of really thick suar. The better but more expensive alternative is American black walnut. These are old trees that have dried out for a long time and usually kiln dried in experienced kilns. They let them dry and crack already so the ones you have will be very stable. Teak is also a great option but will not give you that sapwood look with the outer edges being lighter colour than the inner core. I got my table from grey and sanders. They are very friendly and you can chit chat with them to ask more about wood. They are at tan boon liat building, so I suggest you put aside a whole day and walk every floor of the building.

59,"Lack of consumer protection or recourse for Singaporeans who lost thousands to interior design scams The excitement of getting new furniture and renovations for their homes turned into a terrible experience of frustration and cheating for several couples who were swindled out of thousands of dollars by a furniture company. Located in the Tan Boon Liat Building, a furniture shop named SOSâ€”sometimes called Collective Living, Prestige Modern Space Living, Teak & Coâ€”trapped several couples who were eager to furnish and upgrade their living space by cheating them out of tens of thousands of dollars and delivering shoddy work. All these cases involve the same company and sometimes even the same person, named Ben or sometimes as Brandon Toh. While it may seem on the surface like a simple case of a company delivery bad work, the method it has employed in conducting these dealings point to a deeper, darker story. Several couples swindled One woman shared a story earlier in August 2020 about this furniture store on the Facebook group â€œSG Blacklists Profiteering Retailersâ€. In a series of screenshots, she notes how she visited the furniture store on the 14th floor of the Tan Boon Liat Building, called SOS. A salesman named Ben or Brandon who claimed to be boss told her that the sofa she purchased could arrive in a month, on 1 March 2020. However, it never did. She messaged him on 5 March to follow up and he simply said that he would revert back to her. Messaging him again about 20 days later, she received no reply. Thatâ€™s when she decided to call. He then told her that the furniture would arrive on 1 April as there was a shipment coming in. A few days after that on 6 April, still no sofa. When asked, he said that the sofa had arrived but the delivery man couldnâ€™t get through to the customer to make the delivery. The woman said she didnâ€™t get any missed calls at all. Once the Circuit Breaker was implemented in April, nothing could be done. So she waited until June. When the sofa finally arrived, it was not to the customised measurements requested and the cushions were the wrong size. In a different case, a woman â€œLeneâ€ shared the story of how she and her partner were cheated out of S$5,000 when they were out shopping for furniture for their first new house. In a post on the site in November 2020, Lene noted that the store had overcharged them for their depositâ€”charging S$5,000 instead of the actual amount of S$1820â€”but refused to refund the excess. When they requested to cancel the order entirely and get a full refund, they got nowhere. For over eight months, the couple have yet to be refunded. Lene noted in her blog that the store became uncontactable after the refund form was filled, and that when they went to the store to ask for an update, they were referred to the companyâ€™s office. Oddly, the company doesnâ€™t actually have an office. Lene notes in her post that the furniture store is not a company name that exists. The parent company P+ Capital Pte Ltd, on the other hand, only has a virtual office. However, that virtual office doesnâ€™t handle P+ Capital. The couple was also given a phone number of Ben who they were told to contact about the issue. However, Ben has blocked their number. The couple have filed a police report on the matter as well as a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal which has ordered the furniture store to make a full refund. There have been several other similar cases like this involving this furniture store as well as the person named Benâ€”some of which involved over S$40,000, and shoddy renovation works which require major rectification. One person paid Ben to do some interior designing and renovation work on their home in August 2020, costing roughly S$86,000. Theyâ€™ve paid up about S$60,000 so far but the work is not even nearly up to par. Ben had apparently agreed to refund the woman S$20,000 on 2 February this year but she hasnâ€™t received a single cent. She also found out that he hadnâ€™t obtained a permit to conduct the renovation works, meaning that she had to apply for it herself after he had already started. Another woman has hired the company for renovation works as well and purchased some furniture from them. However, he had made a mess of the carpentry and wet works. She terminated the contract. However, she had already forked out roughly S$26,000 for the works including about S$8,000 for furniture which was delivered to the house while the renovation was ongoing. Yet another person who hired this name found that he has just dismantled her cabinets, stuck some stickers on it to make it look new and reattached it. His shoddy work extended to using glue to attach tiles and neglecting to do water proofing works where needed. He also installed tiles without letting them choose their own designs, saying that he will take care of everything. Laws not enough to protect consumers or provide avenues for redress A common thread in all these stories is also that this Ben person is quite sneaky in how he deals with his â€˜clientsâ€™. Several people pointed out how the furniture is delivered right in the middle of renovation works and in a way that leaves the couples with no option but to accept the furniture. They are unable to inspect or test it. Once the furniture is received, they are less likely to be able to claim â€˜fraudâ€™, as one lady point out. This leaves them with fewer options to go after the people involved. To add another layer of frustration, while police reports have been made by those who were cheated, the police are not exactly treating these cases as a cheating but merely a â€œdisputeâ€. This is where the furniture delivery tactic comes in. Once the furniture is delivered, the victims canâ€™t quite claim that they have been cheated since they did receive furniture. It then becomes just a dispute on the furniture that was deliveredâ€”in terms of dimensions, quality, etc. Now, TOC understands that this Ben person is involved in a few other corporate disputes as well. We also understand that the person in charge of these stores, Ms Lou Zou Yee listed as the director of the company, has not been called in for questioning by the police. TOC did visit the store and asked to meet with the person involved. However, the person was not there at the time. Despite several attempts to reach out, we have been unable to get in touch with him for a response on this matter. At first glance, the company appears to be a legitimate furniture store specialising in teak wood furniture. They even attached â€˜SOLDâ€™ labels on some of the furniture in the store, selling the idea that the business is doing well. But closer inspection reveals that the labels are actually quite old. Itâ€™s nothing more than a farce. One victim shared that they trusted him and the photos he sent as reference of his past work seemed legitimate at first glance. However, in hindsight, she recalled that he had never explicit claimed that the photos were of his own work. In fact, a close look reveals the photos to be that of showrooms and the work of other interior designers. He was merely passing them off as references but careful not to explicitly say it was his. The victim also recalled how insistent he was on making payment via cash, bank transfer or PayNow, claiming that credit cards would incur a 7 percent GST. Many of these victims note how difficult it is to get in touch with Ben, especially once they begin to doubt his work or demand a refund or termination of contract. When they do manage to get hold of, he piles on excuses, doing all his to avoid refunding them. Sometimes, he downright just ignored them. Several of these victims have made police reports against Ben and the company but to no avail. They also attempted to seek redress in the Small Claims Tribunals. As the case of Lene, we know even that is not useful as Ben can just avoid paying them the amount the court ordered him to do. These cases, and many like them, highlight how Singaporeâ€™s consumer protection laws are not powerful enough to protect them. It also shows how little efforts are being made to help those who have been scammed. Lack of active enforcement and deterrence by authorities and agencies in Singapore to protect consumers And these are just the tip of the iceberg in Singapore. TOC has reported on similar cases in the past. Earlier in 2014, we reported on how 13 families were cheated by an interior designer who misrepresented his former employer, took their deposit for renovation work and disappeared with work left half done. The interior designer would accept the renovation jobs from the families, take the deposit, start the â€œrenovationâ€ work by hacking up the floor, and then disappear, leaving the family with a bare uneven concrete floor which they sometimes have to put up with for months. However, the police had initially classified these as civil cases and did not record them down. The police then advised the families to seek legal redress. The case was only classified as cheating after the families banded together to insist that the police file their cases. Unfortunately, even with an investigation officer being assigned to the case, not much was done to update the families at the time. It seems that the burden is on the victims to file civil claims against the company that cheated them while the police treats the matter as a commercial dispute between a willing buyer and a seller. The victims in these cases have filed complaint to The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) but the agency will do nothing more than register their complaint and write a friendly letter of demand. In rare cases where police takes active steps, it is after the case goes public. For example, like the case of the Vietnamese tourist who was cheated out of his money at a cellphone shop in Sim Lim Square back in November 2014. CASE had received over 25 complaints from the public between August to October 2014 prior to the incident with the tourist, yet no action was taken in regards to the shop in question. It was in 2015, that five men related to the now-defunct Mobile Air Pte Ltd, including its former owner Jover Chew, were detained over a series of cheating cases at Sim Lim Square. Despite police reports were lodged against the company for alleged unfair and dishonest sales tactics, with customers complaining that they were coerced into buying mobile phones and in-house warranties at inflated prices due to hidden terms and agreement in the sale contract, both the Police and CASE only took action after the video of the poor Vietnamese tourist begging on the floor went viral. Back to this case, Lene approached CASE and asked them to list this companyâ€™s address as a company alert list. In response, they said that there needs to be a lot of complaints against the company before they can put the company up. Lene asked, â€œhow to, when they can change (their company name) everyday?â€ So as a buyer and consumer, you have to always be cautious because you cannot rely on the police, CASE, or even the small claims tribunal to get your money back once youâ€™ve been cheated out of it. The best bet at getting some form of justice, may be very well be having your story heard in social media. https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/202...-design-scams/",2021,0.045870967741935484,0.8869247311827957,0.06719354838709678,-0.0829247311827957

(Buy Buy Buy Mai Tu Liao!) especially when there is a sale... since there is not much of a difference if you buy now or later... since there is a sale... might as well! Especially if it is a necessity and not want for your new home. For furniture, since ours a mainly a Scandinavian theme, we go for mostly pencil leg furniture... which makes our living space looks bigger. TIP: - Sign up for Robinson OCBC card, it will be very useful especially the additional 5% cash rebates + close door sales for members! - Takashimaya vouchers is very valuable as it has no expiry date! So store it for your new home purchases! Any other vouchers like Robinsons voucher also very valuable to save further for your home needs purchase. Furnitures: 1. Comfort Design Furniture - http://www.comfortfurniture.com.sg/ We find their prices slightly more competitive than Castlery. Quality wise is still very decent for this price. We bought our Sofa set, Dining Table set (bench + 2 chairs), small coffee table. 2. Scanteak - http://www.scanteak.com.sg/ This is more of a want... as I quite love the solid build of their furniture, so decided to splurge on their bed frame for the Master bedroom and also a small sturdy table that is on sale to hold my dry cabinet of my precious camera equipment. 3. Muji - http://www.muji.com.sg/ My wife love their stand mirror (full length), since we got a $30 313 voucher which we got from the purchase of a Sony TV, might as well! 4. Robinsons - http://robinsons.com.sg/ We missed out on their black friday sale to purchase their Simmons backcare 4 series mattress which goes as low as $3.2k after discounts and members rebate as my friend's card limit wasn't enough, and that pushes me to go apply the card myself lol. We placed a $200 deposit with Robinson Bedshop (look for Sheila if you want to purchase Simmons mattress) at their Heeren branch. This effectively locks their price (which ever is lower when there is a promo). So as of now we are still waiting for their additional 10% card member rebate... We also bought loads of other stuffs which I will cover later below. 5. Inkagu - https://www.inkagu.com/products/shin-ju-mattress Always see their special price mattress ad on Facebook and since it cost only $299... so BBBMTL, this is for our guestroom. 6. Ki-mono - http://www.ki-mono.net A pity they are closing down... they have very nice japanese theme furnitures which we can match our Scandinavian theme. We bought a rack for kitchen use and also a clothe rack at very attractive closing down sale price. Appliances: 1. Sony store @ 313 Just happens so... my buddy's wife works at Sony so yes! we can get staff price. Bought Sony TV KDL-55W800C at $1.2k+! Cheap right? 2. Heritage Bathroom Gallery Ironically we didn't buy any bathroom stuffs from them but bought from them a Fujioh hob & hood set and Bosch oven ($50 cheaper than other shops we went!). 3. Gain City Initially we wanted to buy our Electrolux washing machine & dryer from Paris Silk but they cannot hold stock for us too long... so in the end we went to Gain City to buy from them. Price slightly higher than what was quoted by Paris Silk. 4. Tim Wong (Aircon) from Renotalk - For our Mitsubishi Starmex (2 tick) air con 5. Mega Discount (Kallang Leisure Park) - https://www.megadiscountstore.com.sg/ Initially we are eyeing a Hitachi or Mitsubishi refrigerator but after the sales person show us what a Samsung fridge can do and the build quality + door test... we are sold! Just hope that it doesn't *chibaboom* later! lol 6. Robinsons Used my wife's vouchers ($350) to buy Zojirushi Induction Heating Rice Cooker NP-HBQ10 which is at promotion price $489 but we only paid $139! Got a free rice stocker as well. 6. Philips Carnival Sale (once a year!) Bought some stuffs during the sale last year, steam garment iron + iron + toaster + kettle. 7. AOSBath - https://www.aosbath.com/ Bought a 40L digital model storage heater (AO Smith) for convenience and electricity savings. 8. HT Lighting (Johor Bahru, Permas Jaya) - http://www.htlightings.com/ Bought ceiling fan Aeratron AE3 50' Light Oak color for 1480rm, SG selling this for $1099 SGD! If anyone need their sales contact number (via whatsapp) to check price before going in to buy let me know! Others: 1. Hansgrohe We bought a bundle deal during their warehouse sale last year October.

Le Creuset, WMF, Corelle, Lock & Lock, Bodum, bedsheets etc during their member or public sale! We also make use of my wife's Citibank redemption of Robinson vouchers as well. I also got my NS voucher which I am keeping to buy the Simmons mattress haha 3. Takashimaya I accumulated $230 voucher prior to this... bought a tefal air fryer on promotion at $279... so we only paid $49 for it LOL 4.

And he chided me; according to him the wedding banquet is not for you/your marriage but for your families, to â€˜thankâ€™ them for raising you to that point. As a dowry he gave his in-laws 5 tables (ie all the ang paos). Like, what? First of all - how is it ok to pay a family for a human being these days? And I think even my parents would agree that if I have 5 figures to spend, itâ€™s better to put it towards creating a perfect forever home, which will last two decades instead of two hours. And as for counting on ang paos (which he says will cover the costs anyway so who cares what you spend), if you wanna serve people dinner for money, open a restaurant. Ang paos and wedding presents are bonuses and well wishes, and who knows how many cheapos youâ€™re related to anyway. I was invited to a wedding at MBS once; I barely knew the guy and I knew I was just a seat-filler, not to mention I was a broke student at the time. Iâ€™m not gonna say the admittedly meager ang pao I gave was the deciding factor, but Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s coincidence that neither bride nor groom spoke to me again afterwards. Iâ€™m personally not particularly keen on putting on a show for people I barely know, and Iâ€™d rather have quartz countertops and a CZ ring than a 1+ ct diamond.

130,"I think there is actually a huge opportunity for this, because the group who can visualize stuff in sketchup and who knows how to design stuff in carpentry is very small. I get most of my furniture made in Indonesia, and the manufacturers designer has a bit of princess syndrome, so whenever I point out that Iâ€™d like something differently itâ€™s weeks before I get any feedback. But I canâ€™t design to the degree that it works for three woodworkers. If you can do both then there is a huge market. In SG, if you want to have furniture that is nice (rules out most teak shops), functional (rules out designer shops) and durable (rules out IKEA), youâ€™re out of luck even if you have deep pockets. And lots of Singaporeans have very deep pockets.

139,"Almost all teak furniture sold in Singapore comes from the Jepara area in Java. Workmanship there varies from very bad to good, with a heavy emphasis on bad.
If you go there yourself, as a foreigner and without very good knowledge, you will almost invariably get bad things at high price - and have to arrange shipment as well (which for individual items is prohibitively expensive). You also have no warranty or recourse if the items fall apart after a few months (which bad quality is bound to).
If you buy from a shop here, the quality isn't necessarily better, but you have a chance to choose. It's buyer beware, so you should first learn what to look out for!
For example: Almost all ""outdoor"" teak available here is varnished. Varnished wood is unsuitable for outdoors and will look ugly after a short while, but the varnish covers up poor wood quality, so it looks better when sold. Good (or in my opinion the only acceptable) outdoor teak comes unvarnished and needs to be oiled regularly. (If you are not prepared to do that, buy plastic instead!)
For indoor furniture, the most important, besides wood quality and age (which is difficult to judge for a layman), is the workmanship of the joints. If there are gaps (often filled with resin and varnished over, so look closely!) or other signs of bad fits, stay away.
Woodcarvings will also often crack and break if the wood is of low quality or the grains go in the wrong direction (most Indonesian carvers don't know about this!).
While I would not call ScanTeak stuff ""good quality"", it is certainly acceptable and better than most (apart from a few very high price specialty suppliers).",2021,0.06833333333333333,0.8136,0.11806666666666667,-0.15008666666666667
