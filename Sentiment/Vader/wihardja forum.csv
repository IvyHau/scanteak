2,"BTW TS I like the way the Peranakan tiles are done here esp if you have very few pieces - save $$ too my Post #429 in http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/ea...#post102824741 and http://www.homeanddecor.com.sg/artic...arm/telokkurau Also look at the floor tiling treatment in kitchen there Spoiler! And the teak furniture piece(s) in the bedroom there ! Wood-tone pieces make up the master bedroom. The window shutter headboard is from Taylor B, while the bedside tables are from Wihardja, and the trunk is from Teak Palace. Spoiler! I think you MIGHT also get some ideas from this kitchen pic I like the pic somehow - find rustic-retro RAW beauty etc in it ! (I have LOTS of pics on kitchens n bathrooms collated these few days on my own Retirement-HDB Thread - for future reference (also for those retro lovers as quite a few vintage look flats etc) ) Spoiler!
