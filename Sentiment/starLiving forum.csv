Bed, small desk, wardrobe etc. Most landlords wouldnâ€™t go through the hassle of cabling LAN from router to the spare room. Hence, itâ€™s the norm to provide just wifi. Most of us rent out spare rooms, so you may be living with the landlord. Get to know them &amp; their rules before committing.
 
 
 
 I used to work in One-North area too :) Iâ€™d recommend staying in the west. If you want to save more, find a house that isnâ€™t near malls, or a little distance away from MRT(bus transfer). You can go to food centres &amp; supermarkets in residential areas. And commute a few stops to malls for shopping/movies on days off. The places I recommend below have malls near the MRT. 
 
 -Buona Vista (Mall: Star Vista/no cinema)
 
 -Jurong East (3 malls. Busy area)
 
 -Bukit Batok (West Mall)
 
 -Boon Lay (Mall: Jurong Point)

then again, i'm still months away from moving in to my new home. will be visiting the big box stores Star living, courts, etc. and hopefully find what i want!

i'm just wondering whether there are any ""lesser known"" stores but selling beautiful solid wood furniture thus for this post..
