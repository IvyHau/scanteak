2,jjcc888,"BTW TS I like the way the Peranakan tiles are done here esp if you have very few pieces - save $$ too my Post #429 in http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/ea...#post102824741 and http://www.homeanddecor.com.sg/artic...arm/telokkurau Also look at the floor tiling treatment in kitchen there Spoiler! And the teak furniture piece(s) in the bedroom there ! Wood-tone pieces make up the master bedroom. The window shutter headboard is from Taylor B, while the bedside tables are from Wihardja, and the trunk is from Teak Palace. Spoiler!

5,The_King,"is solid wood furniture. like Scanteak, namu wood furniture, Wihardja Furniture, picket and rail worth it?",Mr.Canberra,IKEA not really the cheapest. Only very few items are cheap to entice shoppers. Marketing gimmick but very effective in persuading consumers to subconciously shell out cash for premium priced products. Only clearance or SOLD AS IT IS stock may be a little bit cheaper. That's all. No way I'm not going to pay 3 figures for particle board furnitures! Cheapest will be online order from shopping platforms. However might be weeks of long wait.,,,"26-07-2016, 09:02 PM",2016,HWZ,"is solid wood furniture. like Scanteak, namu wood furnishings, Wihardja Furniture, picket and rail worth it?"
6,KenQuek,"Personally i think furniture like console with cabinet, desks and dining table should go for solid wood.
