5,The_King,"is solid wood furniture. like scanteak, namu wood furniture, wihardja furniture, picket and rail worth it?",Mr.Canberra,IKEA not really the cheapest. Only very few items are cheap to entice shoppers. Marketing gimmick but very effective in persuading consumers to subconciously shell out cash for premium priced products. Only clearance or SOLD AS IT IS stock may be a little bit cheaper. That's all. No way I'm not going to pay 3 figures for particle board furnitures! Cheapest will be online order from shopping platforms. However might be weeks of long wait.,,,"26-07-2016, 09:02 PM",2016,HWZ
6,KenQuek,"personally i think furniture like console with cabinet, desks and dining table should go for solid wood. others like window side or pedestal cabinets can go for compressed wood if you intend to replace in future.",The_King,"is solid wood furniture. like Scanteak, namu wood furniture, Wihardja Furniture, picket and rail worth it?",,,"26-07-2016, 09:02 PM",2016,HWZ
