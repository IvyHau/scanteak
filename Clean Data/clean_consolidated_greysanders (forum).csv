4,theblueark,"have heard from various wood experts not to get suar. suar is a fast growing indonesian tree. the problem is because it grows fast, the core is relatively young and not dried out. coupled with the fact that indonesian kilns are also relatively new, less skilled and impatient. what happens is you get a wood table that is still drying out and changing shape. over time it will crack. what some factories try to do to counter this is to make table tops out of really thick suar. the better but more expensive alternative is american black walnut. these are old trees that have dried out for a long time and usually kiln dried in experienced kilns. they let them dry and crack already so the ones you have will be very stable. teak is also a great option but will not give you that sapwood look with the outer edges being lighter colour than the inner core. i got my table from grey and sanders. they are very friendly and you can chit chat with them to ask more about wood. they are at tan boon liat building, so i suggest you put aside a whole day and walk every floor of the building. there are a whole lot of other furtniture shops there, many of them specializing in solid wood, especially teak. can go and ask all of them about their opinion on suar.",,,,,"09-07-2018, 12:16 PM",2018,HWZ

8,theblueark,"if you buying from local shops you can guess which variation they are selling. the honest ones will tell you the truth too. a lot of our teak is indonesian. cos burmese teak is very expensive now. burmese teak are from very old trees. stronger, darker in colour. walnut is very confusing cos there are many versions and imposters. 1. american black walnut (juglans nigra) - the best you can get, grows in north america. 2. south american walnut (albizia saman) - totally different species but looks similar at first glance cos it also has sapwood. grows in south america 3. suar, raintree, monkeypod - same as 2. but exported by the spanish to s.e asia. the weather is different here so the wood grows differently. less dense, softer and more unstable than the south american ones. i didn't read up much on rosewood and oak when buying my furniture. some honest people i know are at tan boon liat where i bought a lot of my stuff. grey and sanders for american black walnut, and unikhome for teak. grey and sanders are nice and friendly and they love wood. so you can go chit chat with them and build your knowledge. unikhome was upfront and honest telling me they use indonesian teak. tan boon liat is really fun to browse, can spend a whole day there. there was one shop selling colonial style rosewood furniture (over $500 per dining chair!)",,,,,"20-08-2018, 11:22 AM",2018,HWZ
