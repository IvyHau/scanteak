91,"Hi Ben, we apologise for the poor experience you had with us. As per our investigation, there seems to be a miscommunication between us. For your kind information, do note that our Jack-N Coffee Table comes with a rotatable drawer on one side and a fixed panel on the other side, hence it requires some allowance for the rotation mechanism to be smooth, which explain the slight slant. In fact, we have been selling this model for quite some time and all customers are able to accept it. Hence, we regret to inform you that we are unable to let you exchange for free as the slight difference in table height is not a product defect. However, should you decide to exchange for another model at a surcharge, do let us know and we will be happy to assist you :)"
92,"Hi Eldad, thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are sorry to hear about the poor experience you had with us.

We have investigated your case. Your sofa has been delivered for 3mths before we receive your first complaint. We have been responsive and have done our best to expedite the repair from the usual 8 weeks down to 1 week, despite currently operating at limited capacity due to COVID-19.

Yesterday, 8 June 2020, we delivered the repaired sofa to you, however it has been rejected due to the uneven foam & you have requested for a refund instead. We regret to inform that as the sofa you bought was a display piece cleared at 20% discount as-is condition, hence it will not be valid for exchange, cancellation or refund as agreed upon purchase.

However, we would still like to make this right for you and have brought the sofa back to service again, we will expedite on this again.

We hope you can see that we are already doing our best for you and we hope you can reconsider and accept the sofa after the 2nd servicing.

Thank you."
93,"Hi George, first and foremost, we would like to apologize for your series of poor experiences with us.

Understand that our delivery team only managed to reach your premise last night at around 11:25pm despite the agreed timing of 7-9pm, we sincerely would like to apologize for that. We seek your kind understanding that we are in our peak season now due to CNY and have been delivering till late night everyday, even to wee hours. Nevertheless, the lack of update from our delivery team on the delay after 9pm is definitely our wrongdoing, and we apologise for that on their behalf.

At the same time, we noted that you have tried to call our Tampines showroom last night to check on the delivery status and it was our sales staff TC Tan who has answered your call. We understood from him that the line was cut off a few times due to poor signal & technical issues, and he did not assist to check with our delivery team on the status of your delivery due to shop closing. This is indeed poor service and very unprofessional, rest assure that we will not tolerate that and a stern warning has been served to TC Tan.

Once again, we apologize for all the inconvenience that we have caused and thank you for your patience and understanding. Your valuable feedback matters to us and rest assure that we will definitely share with our delivery team & TC Tan to improve on it.

Understand that there is no further issue after the installation yesterday, hence we would like to close this case on our end. Should there be any issue pertaining to product, do feel free to contact us at 6269-2022 or customercare@sg.starintlgroup.com.

Hereby wishing you & family a happy & prosperous CNY, stay safe!"
94,"Hi Rachel, thank you for your review. We are really glad that you have enjoyed your time with us and especially so with our Sales Staff - Andrew. We will definitely share it with him and our Management. Thank you 😊"
95,"Hi Rui Fa Lin, thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We're sorry to hear about your experience with us. Regret to inform that as of now, we do not have any tie ups or regular contractors that we work with with regards to such wet works, hence we are not able to provide any suitable recommendations. We seek your kind understanding in this matter. Thank you."
96,"Hi Wilma, thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are sorry to hear about the poor experience you had with our Hercules Chair. We have checked your record, your Chairs have actually been delivered 22 months ago.

For your kind information, our Hercules Chair is made of PU (a synthetic leather) and not genuine leather. Do note that PU is an eco-friendly material with a nice soft touch, hence is less resistant to stress and may peel over time. Furthermore, peeling may occur due to many reasons, such as usage, environment (eg humidity, direct sunlight), wear and tear etc. But generally with proper care, PU products should be able to last 2-3 years minimally.

Usually, we will still be able to provide reupholstery at a fee for on-going models even as long as more than 5 years. Unfortunately, Hercules Dining Chair has been discontinued by the factory itself; hence we regret to inform that we will not be able to repair it & we seek your understanding in this matter.

Understand that our sales staff has already contacted you to propose some resolutions, hence we will proceed to close this loop on our end.

Once again, we apologise for the inconveniences caused and we thank you for selecting Star Living (LUCANO) as your preferred retailer. We sincerely look forward to be at your service again."

199,So so furniture
200,Staff are quite pushy and they follow you around as if you might run off with their dining table anytime. Redeeming factor will be the affordability of their furnitures.

214,"The biggest star living store I have been. If you are going to star living, only go to this store."
215,The furniture are pretty average looking. Some are not even worth looking at. Value for money but i wouldn't want to put any of these furniture in my house. Folks with budget would find this place pretty good.
216,"The place is good, gives you a variety of choice but what stands out for me is James who is the store manager. There was a compatibility issue for the bed and mattress that I bought from here in terms of size but James was quick to resolve the issue which is an example of great customer service"

247,Waste of time going to this place. Sales person lacks the knowledge - absolutely no business sense. Asked if they can recommend a 3rd party contractor to install a plaster wall behind the wardrobe - clueless and no idea. Pricing is not exactly cheap. No wonder we are being replaced by foreigners.

257,"Went there to search for a storage bed and was assisted by Jason. Really nice and approaching sales man. Knowledge and willing to go the extra mile to ask for arrangements.
