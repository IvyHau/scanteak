1,WittyKap0,"depends on what you consider decent if you want solid wood base probably need 3-4k and up. can look at king living for something cheaper in the 1k+ range those cheap taobao couch at places like castlery can cost 500-1k but durability and comfort is super low. you can probably get some cheaper sofas from the big furniture stores but personally they look ugly and old fashioned, comfort isn't great either. but really depends on personal taste",-,-,/r/singapore/comments/k5jlln/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/gefztly/,1.0,singapore,3/12/2020 02:07,2020,Reddit

Happened to try to Hilker Full Latex and Latex + Spring yesterday at Harvey Norman (Millenia Walk) and went down to Dormiente, European Bedding and Uni Spring today. My fiance and I were impressed with the latex mattresses and i think it is really not easy to make a choice among them. Hilker - They have full latex and latex + spring series. But i think this brand isn't discussed much here, so not much reviews gathered. - Was initially impressed but after trying the Dormiente, Heveya and MaxCoil today, we are probably not going to consider this even though Harvey Normal has attractive promotions now, additional 30% on top of 30% promo. Dormiente We are interested with getting the EU/SG Queen Mattress, have to say it is really comfortable. We do have some concerns, namely: - the mattress is 18cm only, is this fairly normal for a full latex mattress as we think it is pretty short compared to European Bedding Heveya 2 (24cm). - While the price of the mattress seems relatively reasonable, the bed frame by them is pretty costly albeit very good quality solid wood. Are there any recommendations where we can get the bed frame (open to non-wood materials)? European Bedding All the 3 models are full natural latex. Like the Heveya 3 but it is like what everyone here mentioned, european price! Add in the Soul & Table bed frame will probably cost more than 8k. Maxcoil @ Unispring Tried the Royal Brilliance, Jardine I & II (all are natural latex topper with spring). - We like Royal Brilliance the most but the bed is really heavy. - While i can feel a little difference compared to the above 2 brands, it is really pretty minimal. - The price seems to be very attractive. Hope to have some advice here. Thanks in advance!",,,,"18-08-2019, 01:08 AM",2019,HardwareZone

127,pacificstorm,"nice to see your response bro. for the european bedding, i am guessing maybe the part timer wanted more commission so push the more ex heveya 2 and 3. didn't had this issue when i was there. in fact comparing heveya 1 which was 19cm of full latex, the 18cm at dormiente would be obsolete base on the part timer's logic, which obviously wasn't the case. in fact i am quite sure with 18 or 19cm it is more than adequate to withhold my weight, i think i wasnt even using any more than 2 inches of the latex (in terms of depression into the mattress) did u also try the maxcoil relaxer by any chance? i feel it felt quite similar to the firm one i tried at dormiente. though it seems most people preferred royal brilliance instead... as for hilker, if u went to their website u would see they are manufactured under hilker sdn bhd, did some googling and it pointed to the following links below. apparently they are under a licensing right of the germany company but made by a factory that produces a few different brands in malaysia. their pricing would be more relevant if it was german made like dormiente, but i don't think it would be reasonable to pay for a ""royalty or licensing"" fee made in malaysia. https://buy.ramcreditinfo.com.my/index.php/search/malaysia-company/1109958/hilker-malaysia-sdn.-bhd the malaysian factory that licenses different brands, https://www.luxurysleep.com hope to hear from you again",snowydust,"For dormiente, i was not served by the owner but a new salesman who just joined the company.
