2,x9200,"another place to take a look around is scanteak. again, this is not a top quality furniture store (i would not recommend to buy anything there for the outdoor), neither the cheapest one but it offers some better balance to the ikea's offer. we decided to have our own furniture ca 5y ago and it took us a few good months to roughly complete the task. we are also a price cautious (low-end expats) but we simply wanted to have something that we like and this something should also last a bit longer. with this conditions it is rather difficult to buy all the stuff in a single place so we just checked around in a number of places and picked up what we wanted. if this matters we prefer rather simplistic, zen-like style. the major concentrations of furniture shops are (at least 5y ago): - the furniture mall (off the beach rd) - the sungei kadut district - probably over dozens of shops all together half of them along sungei kadut ave - dempsey area shops (already gone) we were disappointed with the furniture mall. it was very expensive for anything we liked over there. all together this is roughly the list of the places we bought some furniture from: 1) http://unicane.com (abaca sofa and chairs) 2) scanteak (few minor tower chests of drawers, all teakish, each piece below $100 and most of them looking like they were made by a drunk carpenter) 3) a lot of stuff from ikea (beno cd racks, expedit shelves) 4) furniture mall (rather expensive, some custom made teak furniture in a place i could not recommend because we almost sued them for the job done and they almost sued me for alleged defamation). 5) dempsey area, holland village, furniture mall (minor furniture, side tables etc.)",sundaymorningstaple,"I've not been to a vhive in a long, long time.

I've looked at Ikea, but they have nothing particularly useful (all coffee tables or odd-shaped things) for my requirements.

Essentially I want a round table (maybe 1m diameter) and 2-4 chairs (could probably get away with 2 cheapo folding chairs from Ikea and 2 that match the table, as it's only me and the missus most of the time).

I've been here about 6 months and still can't get my head around Singaporean websites - none of them have prices on which means I spend more time clicking ""back"" than I do looking at the designs...

I'm looking to spend 2-400 dollars (ideally at the low end). Most of the major ones I've seen recommended (OHMM etc) seem to charge about this per chair.

Has anyone used the furniture sales that I've seen online? Would they be worth a shot? I can't be bothered to get a cab to go there if I find out the prices are still astronomically high. Any advice/experience would be welcome.

5,sundaymorningstaple,for mid-upper range furniture you can do scanteak or pickett & rail.,Girl_Next_Door ,"I would think furniture and art might be some things you want to consider?

Yes, Singapore have Ikea and several cheap options. However, there isn't exactly much ""in-between"" and ""good quality"" furniture around (or I am looking at the wrong places). Also assuming that you plan to get a bigger apartment (with 2 kids), I find most of the furnitures here are quite small. A lot of 2 or 3 seaters, but very few 6 or 8 seaters that doesn't cost 5-figures.

And of course, you can find a fully furnished apartment/condo but very often, it will be furnished in accordance to the owner's taste and/or in cheap furniture.

For art work, I am sure many people will say you can get cheap art work in neighbouring countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Personally, I like unique modern art pieces and most often, art work found in Thailand & Vietnam are duplicates.",https://forum.singaporeexpats.com/viewtopic.php?t=69203&start=15,0.0,Forum,30/04/2010 04:10pm,2010,Singapore Expat,Scanteak

50,testerjp,"tried them at hn and quite pricey, not sure if it's pure latex top, don't feel so to me for those in the affordable range. mattresses are suppose to be replaced once every 6-8 years. so not sure if you really wish to fork that amount every time. research shows that replacing the mattress regularly provides the best support to the back as the mattress will sag or the springs will lose its dexterity. i was looking for latex top too, scanteak was selling at $14xx, tilamking $17xx. 65% of the rubber in the world comes from south east asia, the rest mostly from asia like india and vietnam. don't make sense to me to get an european brand for latex, most likely they will need to import the latex, process then export, adds up to cost for nothing. malaysian or indonesian brands are cheap and good, lucky singapore happen to be right beside both of them.",Junky_89,"Hi, anyone have tried or did researched on Harvey Norman Hilker mattress?

81,pacificstorm,"wow! finally someone who went to all the shops i went to. for dormiente, was the one you tried the one where u could split the mattress into the male and female one? i remember the 18cm version was their classic range. the lady actually introduced the 23cm range with the horsehair? for me as she said i was slighty heavier (90kg heavy to german company meh... ) you are right to say 18cm is on the thin side though but i would say with a full latex mattress that is unlikely to affect the feel or performance of the mattress. from her explanations i also heard they had a coconut coir version used in their firmest bed, if u were looking at that version, i would strongly suggest going without the coconut (again) with european bedding i was actually looking at heveya 1, the one with only 1 layer of latex. this solely based on my personal logic that if i do use different layers of latex they must be varying densities which makes my money less worthwhile if i get lower density one . i remember this is 19cm high, still abit low. but the price range also on the lower side. i ultimately decided with european bedding over dormiente as i done some research online and found that the latexco company was alot more renown and seems to be the largest latex mnc that even have plants in usa. i was also slightly skeptical about the horse hair on the dormiente tbh. at the imm shop, actually i tried the maxcoil relaxer which was their latex mattress first and that was what i shortlisted. it didn't have the fanciful 7 zone latex like the 2 brands neither was it organic latex (although i personally think natural is enough, organic probably doesn't matter since not food..) but the price also more attractive obviously. this one was a 25cm so actually more good height for us. the very friendly guy then told us to try the royal brilliance, said it was their best selling model. if u followed my post u would have known for i actually only look at full latex mattress... but eventually the feel of the mattress was good and convincingly enough that the 4"" of latex at the top is good enough (this time i was called average weight hahahahah). more importantly the latex is also made by latexco so they were actually similar to what i saw at european bedding, plus the info presented on the mattress were similar. honestly if u ask me, i would only choose between the heveya 1 and royal brilliance. (my wife doesn't like the maxcoil relaxer for unknown reasons). u would have seen another bro chaos that had booked the relaxer but seems his partner also like royal better ************************************ as for hilker, i do remember searching on it being a malaysian company licensed from the germans. so the price doesn't make sense at all. for the frame, i would reccomend not getting from dormiente or european bedding. afterall they are latex producers not wood company... u may be better off with scanteak or castlery etc for wooden frames? any idea btw if the aussino is like the old aussino or they sell completely diff stuff now? think they disappeared for a long time",snowydust,"Hello everyone, I have been reading through the 200+ pages for the past few days as i plan to get a bed for my new home. Happened to try to Hilker Full Latex and Latex + Spring yesterday at Harvey Norman (Millenia Walk) and went down to Dormiente, European Bedding and Uni Spring today. My fiance and I were impressed with the latex mattresses and i think it is really not easy to make a choice among them. Hilker - They have full latex and latex + spring series. But i think this brand isn't discussed much here, so not much reviews gathered. - Was initially impressed but after trying the Dormiente, Heveya and MaxCoil today, we are probably not going to consider this even though Harvey Normal has attractive promotions now, additional 30% on top of 30% promo. Dormiente We are interested with getting the EU/SG Queen Mattress, have to say it is really comfortable. We do have some concerns, namely: - the mattress is 18cm only, is this fairly normal for a full latex mattress as we think it is pretty short compared to European Bedding Heveya 2 (24cm). - While the price of the mattress seems relatively reasonable, the bed frame by them is pretty costly albeit very good quality solid wood. Are there any recommendations where we can get the bed frame (open to non-wood materials)? European Bedding All the 3 models are full natural latex. Like the Heveya 3 but it is like what everyone here mentioned, european price! Add in the Soul & Table bed frame will probably cost more than 8k. Maxcoil @ Unispring Tried the Royal Brilliance, Jardine I & II (all are natural latex topper with spring). - We like Royal Brilliance the most but the bed is really heavy. - While i can feel a little difference compared to the above 2 brands, it is really pretty minimal. - The price seems to be very attractive.

85,domon17th,bro just curious. any reason why you didn't consider getha or mylatex?,pacificstorm,"Wow! Finally someone who went to all the shops I went to. For dormiente, was the one you tried the one where u could split the mattress into the male and female one? I remember the 18cm version was their classic range. The lady actually introduced the 23cm range with the horsehair? For me as she said I was slighty heavier (90kg heavy to german company meh... ) You are right to say 18cm is on the thin side though but I would say with a full latex mattress that is unlikely to affect the feel or performance of the mattress. From her explanations I also heard they had a coconut coir version used in their firmest bed, if u were looking at that version, I would strongly suggest going without the coconut (again) With European bedding I was actually looking at heveya 1, the one with only 1 layer of latex. This solely based on my personal logic that if I do use different layers of latex they must be varying densities which makes my money less worthwhile if I get lower density one . I remember this is 19cm high, still abit low. But the price range also on the lower side. I ultimately decided with european bedding over dormiente as I done some research online and found that the Latexco company was alot more renown and seems to be the largest latex MNC that even have plants in USA. I was also slightly skeptical about the horse hair on the Dormiente tbh. At the IMM shop, actually I tried the maxcoil relaxer which was their latex mattress first and that was what I shortlisted. It didn't have the fanciful 7 zone latex like the 2 brands neither was it Organic latex (although I personally think natural is enough, organic probably doesn't matter since not food..) but the price also more attractive obviously. This one was a 25cm so actually more good height for us. The very friendly guy then told us to try the royal brilliance, said it was their best selling model. If u followed my post u would have known for I actually only look at full latex mattress... but eventually the feel of the mattress was good and convincingly enough that the 4"" of latex at the top is good enough (this time I was called average weight hahahahah). More importantly the latex is also made by latexco so they were actually similar to what I saw at European bedding, plus the info presented on the mattress were similar. Honestly if u ask me, I would only choose between the heveya 1 and royal brilliance. (My wife doesn't like the maxcoil relaxer for unknown reasons). U would have seen another bro chaos that had booked the relaxer but seems his partner also like royal better ************************************ As for hilker, I do remember searching on it being a malaysian company licensed from the germans. So the price doesn't make sense at all. For the frame, I would reccomend not getting from dormiente or european bedding. Afterall they are latex producers not wood company... u may be better off with scanteak or castlery etc for wooden frames?

87,pacificstorm,"nice to see your response bro. for the european bedding, i am guessing maybe the part timer wanted more commission so push the more ex heveya 2 and 3. didn't had this issue when i was there. in fact comparing heveya 1 which was 19cm of full latex, the 18cm at dormiente would be obsolete base on the part timer's logic, which obviously wasn't the case. in fact i am quite sure with 18 or 19cm it is more than adequate to withhold my weight, i think i wasnt even using any more than 2 inches of the latex (in terms of depression into the mattress) did u also try the maxcoil relaxer by any chance? i feel it felt quite similar to the firm one i tried at dormiente. though it seems most people preferred royal brilliance instead... as for hilker, if u went to their website u would see they are manufactured under hilker sdn bhd, did some googling and it pointed to the following links below. apparently they are under a licensing right of the germany company but made by a factory that produces a few different brands in malaysia. their pricing would be more relevant if it was german made like dormiente, but i don't think it would be reasonable to pay for a ""royalty or licensing"" fee made in malaysia. https://buy.ramcreditinfo.com.my/index.php/search/malaysia-company/1109958/hilker-malaysia-sdn.-bhd the malaysian factory that licenses different brands, https://www.luxurysleep.com hope to hear from you again",snowydust,"For dormiente, i was not served by the owner but a new salesman who just joined the company.

89,testerjp,"most companies use the dunlop vulcanization method for producing the latex, not that there are no synthetic material used but the chance is lesser. more or less, there should be some stabilisers. even if there's any, i reckon that it will still be better than memory foam or high density foam made out of petroleum, which also traps the most heat. all i can see from the online description for mylatex is they label as fully natural with nothing synthetic for most range. their price is the cheapest and they been around for quite some time. of course, how true are their words will be up to you to decide. that easyhouse website is the cheapest but i could also find such prices from a brick and mortar shop at alexandra village. i've tried mylatex from a shop at imm, their prices are pricey. scanteak and tilamking also have latex top range. there are also brands like getha, dormiente, etc. you can check those out if you want. mylatex seems to sell via reseller network, don't expect those sales staff's knowledge to be much.",,,,,Forum,3/7/18 02:00,2018,HardwareZone,scanteak
